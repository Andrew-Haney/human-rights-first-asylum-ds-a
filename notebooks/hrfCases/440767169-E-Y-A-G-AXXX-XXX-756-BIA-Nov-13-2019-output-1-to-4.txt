In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Heain Lee, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Elizabeth M. Dewar
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
April 17, 2019, decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture. See sections 208, 241(b)(3) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. $ 1208.16(c). The Department of
Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
We conclude that a remand is appropriate for the Immigration Judge to reassess the
respondent's credibility. The Immigration Judge made an adverse credibility finding, but, as the
respondent argues on appeal, he was not confronted with and given an opportunity to explain the
perceived discrepancies and omissions relied upon by the Immigration Judge (IJ at 2-5;
Respondent's Br. at 14-15). The Board defers to an adverse credibility finding where, among other
things, “a convincing explanation for the discrepancies and omissions” has not been supplied by
the respondent. Matter of A-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 1106, 1109 (BIA 1998). As the respondent points
out, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises,
has reasoned, with respect to corroboration, that “[t]he requirement that the applicant provide a
reasonable explanation ... 'presumes that the IJ offers a petitioner an opportunity to explain....
Lin-Jian v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 182, 192 (4th Cir. 2007) (quoting Obale v. Att 'y Gen. of U.S.,
453 F.3d 151, 163 (3d Cir. 2006)).
If the respondent is found credible on remand, we conclude that his asylum application should
be treated as timely filed. See sections 208(a)(2)(B), (D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2),
(4)(i)(B). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent's claim regarding his brothers' gang
activity is not time-barred, a determination that the DHS does not challenge on appeal (IJ at 6).
Further, assuming the facts as presented by the respondent to be truc, including the respondent's
testimony that his cousins were killed in 2014, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that the
respondent did not establish changed circumstances regarding his claim of persecution on account
Cite as: E-Y-A-G-, AXXX XXX 756 (BIA Nov. 13, 2019)
-756
of his political opinion (IJ at 5-6; Tr. at 92; Exh. 5). See Zambrano v. Sessions, 878 F.3d 84, 88
(4th Cir. 2017) (holding that “[n]ew facts that provide additional support for a pre-existing asylum
claim can constitute a changed circumstance").
Additionally, the Immigration Judge determined that, even assuming that the respondent was
credible and that his asylum application was timely filed, the respondent did not demonstrate that
his fear of future persecution in El Salvador was well-founded or that he is more likely than not to
be persecuted in El Salvador (IJ at 6-7). The Immigration Judge specifically found it “plausible
that persecution based on a protected ground could be found,” assuming credibility and timeliness
(IJ at 6).
Given this apparent past persecution finding, the respondent is entitled to a presumption of a
well-founded fear of persecution or, in the withholding of removal context, a presumption that his
life or freedom would be threatened in the future on the basis of the original claim. 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.13(b)(1), 1208.16(b)(1)(i). That presumption may be rebutted by the DHS upon a
showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there has been a fundamental change in
circumstances such that the respondent no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution or that he
could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of El Salvador and that, under all the
circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A),
(B), (ii), 1208.16(b)(1)(i)(A), (B), (ii); see Matter of D-I-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448, 450 (BIA 2008)
(discussing the burden-shifting that occurs if an Immigration Judge finds that an applicant
established past persecution).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
It is unclear whether the Immigration Judge properly shifted the burden to DHS (IJ at 6). See
Matter of D-I-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 451 (remanding where an Immigration Judge “did not explicitly
apply the presumption and failed to shift the burden of proof to the DHS to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that the respondent can avoid future persecution by relocating to
another part of Kenya and that it would be reasonable for him to do so"). Further, although the
Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent could safely relocate, the respondent correctly
points out that the Immigration Judge did not make any findings regarding whether relocation
would be reasonable under all the circumstances (IJ at 6; Respondent's Br. at 16-18). See 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.13(b)(3) (setting forth the factors to consider in determining the reasonableness of internal
relocation), 1208.16(b)(3) (same).
The Board has limited fact-finding abilities in deciding appeals. See 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3);
Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We will therefore remand the record to the
Immigration Judge for further proceedings. In the remanded proceedings, the Immigration Judge
should afford the respondent an opportunity to explain any discrepancies and omissions identified
by the Immigration Judge as supporting the adverse credibility finding and then reassess his
credibility. The Immigration Judge should also determine whether the DHS carried its burden to
establish that the respondent can avoid future persecution by relocating within El Salvador, and
whether relocation is reasonable under all of the relevant circumstances. In light of the remand to
reassess the respondent's credibility and whether the DHS rebutted the presumption of a well-
founded fear of persecution, we decline to address the respondent's remaining appellate arguments
at this time.
