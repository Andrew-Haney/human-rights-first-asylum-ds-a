In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Matthew K. Borowski, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ukraine, timely appeals the Immigration Judge's
March 27, 2018, decision. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged,
denied his applications for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant to sections 208 and
241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &$ 1158 and 1231(b)(3) (2012),
respectively, and protection under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.16(c)(2) (2018), and ordered the respondent removed. On appeal, the respondent contests
the denial of all three forms of relief and protection. The appeal will be sustained, and the record
will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and for the entry of a new
decision.

The respondent claims to have experienced past persecution, and to fear future persecution,
due to his sexual orientation (IJ at 3; Tr. at 71-72; Exh 2). The Immigration Judge denied the
respondent's asylum application, as well as his application for withholding of removal under
section 241(b)(3) of the Act, on the basis that the respondent was not credible (IJ at 7-12). This
Board must defer to the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including findings as to the
credibility of testimony, unless they are clearly erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2017);
see also Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (stating that the Board must defer
to the factual determinations of an Immigration Judge in the absence of clear error); Matter of A-S-,
21 I&N Dec. 1106, 1109-12 (BIA 1998) (noting that because an Immigration Judge has the ability
to see and hear witnesses, he or she is in the best position to determine the credibility of such
witnesses). We find clear error in the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility finding, and will
reverse it. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007).
The Immigration Judge rendered his adverse credibility finding based on several purported
inconsistencies and omissions, which he found served to undermine the respondent's credibility.
First, the Immigration Judge observed that the respondent submitted a statement in support of his
application in which he referred to a longtime boyfriend, who he consistently referred to as
“M" (IJ at 7-8; Exh. 6, Tab B). However, in his testimony, the respondent consistently
referred to that same person as “K” (IJ at 7; Tr. at 73-75). When questioned about the
discrepancy, the respondent explained that the name “M was a formal name, while the name
“K is the informal form of the same name - an explanation that the Immigration Judge found
not to be credible (IJ at 8). We find clear error in this finding.

-343
Notably, the respondent initially submitted his hand-written asylum statement along with his
asylum application in 2009 (Exh. 2C). At that time, the translator consistently translated the name
as written by the respondent in Ukrainian as “K” which is the same name the respondent
used in his testimony. The respondent then re-submitted a photocopied version of the same
handwritten asylum statement in 2017, along with a new translation of the statement by a different
translator (Tr. at 67-68; Exh. 6, Tab B). This new translation closely tracks the prior translation
by a different translator in all material respects, with the important exception being that she
consistently translated the respondent's boyfriend's name as “M (Id.). The fact that two
different professional translators translated the same name in the respondent's statement
differently - as “Kostya” in one instance and, in the second, as “M - provides strong evidence
in support of the respondent's contention that “M and “K
are simply two versions of
the same Ukrainian name, one fornal and one informal, and can be used interchangeably (Tr. at
115).
The Immigration Judge also observed that in his written asylum statement, the respondent set
forth six different incidents of harm, spanning from 2002 to 2008, but only testified to five of these
incidents at his hearing (IJ at 9-10). Similarly, the Immigration Judge faulted the respondent for
not recalling, or recalling incorrectly, the details of some of these incidents (IJ at 8-11). However,
as noted by the respondent's counsel on appeal, the respondent wrote this statement in 2009, and
submitted it along with his asylum application at that time (Exh. 2). Thus, the incidents were fairly
fresh in the respondent's mind at that time he wrote it, with the most recent incident having
occurred only 1 year earlier.

By contrast, when the respondent testified in 2018, the most recent incident was fully a decade
earlier, with some of the more remote incidents having occurred nearly two decades before his
testimony. As such, it was entirely reasonable for the respondent to have forgotten one incident,
and forgotten or mixed up the details of these events, which were both numerous and remote in
time. Indeed, the respondent himself repeatedly testified that he could not recall certain aspects of
the incidents “because it was so long ago," or similar words to that effect (Tr. at 76, 80, 81, 83,
116, 119 and 120). Moreover, we note that these incidents were traumatic in nature, involved the
sensitive issue of the respondent's sexuality, and mostly occurred when the respondent was a
young teenager (Tr. at 121). Thus, the few difficulties the respondent experienced in recalling
these incidents, most of which he testified to in sufficient detail and correctly, are insufficient to
support an overall adverse credibility finding.
Finally, the Immigration Judge faulted the respondent for testifying that he is now
heterosexual, but then indicating that he is in fact bisexual (IJ at 11-12). This characterization does
not sufficiently reflect the nuance of the respondent's statements. The respondent's counsel asked
the respondent how he identified “as far as sexual orientation is concemed,” to which the
respondent replied “I don't know how to respond” (Tr. at 90). The respondent was then asked
about his current relationship, to which testified that he is currently in a relationship with a woman,
with whom he fathered a 4-year-old child (Tr. at 90). The respondent's counsel then asked the
respondent “So, are you heterosexual now?” to which the respondent answered “You can say so.
Yes” – a rather equivocal response (Tr. at 90). However, the respondent then immediately clarified
that he was still interested in men, and sometimes still had sexual relationships with men (Tr. at
90-93). The respondent was then directly asked “Do you identify as bisexual,” to which he
2

-343
responded “Yes” (Tr. at 93). We discern no real inconsistency here. The respondent clearly was
initially unsure how to answer the question about his sexual orientation, and only answered when
questions were posed in a way as to essentially “put words in his mouth,” to which he could give
only a “yes” or “no” answer. The respondent's overall testimony that he was attracted to, and had
relations with, both men and women indicates that he is bisexual, regardless of the respondent's
difficulty and unease in adopting a strict label. Accordingly, we will reverse the Immigration
Judge's adverse credibility finding, and we determine that the respondent is credible.
In addition, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not met his burden of proof
for asylum or withholding of removal because he had not supported his claim with reasonably-
available corroborating evidence (IJ at 12-13). See section 208(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act (stating that
“[w]here the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates
otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have
the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence”); Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516,
519 (BIA 2015) (stating that the REAL ID Act makes it “clear that an applicant who seeks asylum
or withholding of removal has the burden of demonstrating eligibility for suc relief, which may
require the submission of corroborative evidence"). On de novo review, we disagree with this
determination.
The only corroborating evidence the Immigration Judge deemed missing was “documentary
evidence of his sexual orientation” (IJ at 12). Specifically, the Immigration Judge found that the
respondent should have provided a statement from his mother, who the respondent testified was
aware of his sexual orientation, as well as statements from “any of his sexual partners” in the
United States (IJ at 12-13). We believe it is not reasonable to expect the respondent to provide
statements from his sexual partners in the United States, with whom he had short-lived or even
one-time relations, and the names of several of whom he could not even recall. We do agree with
the Immigration Judge that a statement from the respondent's mother would have been helpful.
However, we note that statements from family members are often given diminished weight. See
Matter of H-L-H- & Z-Y-Z-, 25 I&N Dec. 209, 215 (BIA 2010) (affording diminished weight to
unswom letters from the alien's friends and family because they were from interested witnesses
not subject to cross-examination and appeared to be created for the purpose of litigation),
remanded on other grounds by Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, 677 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2012). In any
case, we do not believe that the lack of a letter from this one source is sufficient to defeat the
respondent's claims for lack of corroboration.

In addition, the respondent stated that at the time he filed his asylum application, he was
assisted by a woman named “O who held herself out to be an attorney, but in fact was not (Tr.
at 86-89, 122-23). The respondent indicated that he did not submit letters or declarations from
people because she did not inform the respondent that he needed to do so, and that, by the time his
current counsel was hired many years later, he had lost contact with several people from his past
(Tr. at 113). We find merit to this assertion. Notably, the Immigration Judge found that the
assistance provided by a was so ineffective that it constituted an “extraordinary circumstance"
sufficient to excuse the untimely filing of his asylum application (IJ at 6-7). Thus, it is likely that
she did not advise the respondent of the need to provide corroborating evidence.

-343
Moreover, we observe that the Immigration Judge did not indicate that he considered all of the
potentially corroborating evidence that the respondent did submit. For example, the respondent
provided medical records contemporaneous to the periods in which he claimed to have been
attacked and suffered injuries, which appear to corroborate his claims (Exh. 2D; Exhs. 6C and E).
Therefore, we will reverse the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent did not
sufficiently corroborate his claims.
Accordingly, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for him to re-assess whether
the respondent has met the burden of proof for the relief he seeks, with consideration of the
respondent's credible and corroborated testimony. On remand, the parties should be afforded an
opportunity to update the record, and to make any additional legal and factual arguments desired
regarding the respondent's eligibility for relief from removal. The Board expresses no opinion
regarding the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
