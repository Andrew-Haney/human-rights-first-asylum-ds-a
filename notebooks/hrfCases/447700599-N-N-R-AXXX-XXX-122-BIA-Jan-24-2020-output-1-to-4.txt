In re: N
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Brian K. Bates, Esquire
APPLICATION: Termination; asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture;
cancellation of removal
The respondent, a native and citizen of Pakistan, is a lawful permanent resident of the
United States. The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge's August 8, 2019, decision
finding that the Department of Homeland Security (**DHS”) established, by clear and convincing
evidence, that he is removable under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(C).
See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(a). The Immigration Judge further denied the respondent's applications for
asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $ 1158;
withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); protection
pursuant to the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c)-1208.18; and cancellation
of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). The record will be remanded.

This Board reviews the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including credibility findings
and predictions as to the likelihood of future events, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
We review all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The DHS alleged that on September 12, 2017, the respondent was convicted of unlawfully
carrying a handgun in violation of section 46.02(b) of the Texas Penal Code (“TPC”) and
discharging a firearm pursuant to TPC § 42.12(b) (IJ at 1; Exh. 1). The respondent argues that the
Immigration Judge did not provide him a fair opportunity to oppose the DHS’s charge that he is
removable under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act as a result of these convictions (Respondent's Br.
at 16-18). See Olabanji v. INS, 973 F.2d 1232, 1234 (5th Cir. 1992) (stating that deportation
proceedings must be conducted in accordance with "due process standards of fundamental
fairness”). We agree.
In the decision currently under review, the Immigration Judge indicates that she sustained the
charge based on the respondent's “admissions, concessions, and the documentary evidence
submitted by the (DHS)” (IJ at 1-2). The transcript shows that on May 9, 2019, the
Immigration Judge continued the proceedings to allow the DHS to obtain certified conviction
documents (Tr. at 2-6). During the ensuing hearing on May 23, 2019, the Immigration Judge
overruled the respondent's objection that the conviction documents acquired by the DHS had not
been properly certified pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.41 (Tr. at 8-11; Exhs. 3-4A). The respondent
then denied the charge, but the Immigration Judge did not permit him to present substantive
argument in support of terminating these removal proceedings (Tr. at 11-12). Furthermore, the

-122
respondent has presented substantive argument on appeal challenging his removability pursuant to
section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act (Respondent's Br. at 20-27). See Bouchikhi v. Holder, 676 F.3d
173, 180 (5th Cir. 2012) (an alien must establish prejudice to prevail on a due process claim). We
will remand the record to provide the respondent an opportunity to raise these contentions before
the Immigration Judge and for the entry of a new decision on the issue of removability.
The respondent also persuasively argues that a remand is required on due process grounds
because the transcript is incomplete (Respondent's Br. at 18-19). See Olabanji v. INS, 973 F.3d
at 1234. Specifically, the transcription of the respondent's testimony on direct examination ends
with the notation “off the record” (Tr. at 115-25). The notation "on the record” then appears and
the Immigration Judge states that support services were able to assist in the fixing of the recording
system (Tr. at 125). The transcription of testimony then resumes at some point during cross
examination, establishing that the remainder of the respondent's testimony on direct examination
and the beginning of his testimony on cross examination was not recorded (Tr. at 125). On remand,
the Immigration Judge should take appropriate steps to ensure the preparation of a full transcript,
which may include permitting the respondent to testify at a de novo hearing.
Additionally, the Immigration Judge ruled that the respondent has established past persecution
in light of his showing when he was previously granted asylum in October of 2005 that he was
persecuted by members of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement on account of his father's affiliation
with the Pakistan Peoples Party (IJ at 2, 5). The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent
no longer has an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of persecution on account of imputed
political opinion (IJ at 5-6). However, as the respondent states in his Notice of Appeal,
Form EOIR-26, in light of his showing of past persecution on account of political opinion, he is
presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of the same basis and the burden
of proof shifts to the Department of Homeland Security to rebut this presumption by showing
either: (a) there has been a fundamental change in circumstances; or (b) the respondent could avoid
persecution by relocating within Pakistan and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so
under all the circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1), (b)(1)(ii); see also 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.16(b)(1)(ii) (the same burden-shifting process applies in the context of withholding of
removal). On remand, the Immigration Judge should determine the respondent's eligibility for
asylum and related relief in a new decision which clearly allocates the burden of proof to the DHS.

Pending the remand, we withhold ruling on the respondent's argument that the Immigration
Judge erroneously denied his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture
(IJ at 9-10; Respondent's Br. at 30-32). Likewise, we do not address the Immigration Judge's
alternative denial of asylum on discretionary grounds (IJ at 7-8).'
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
! On remand, the Immigration Judge and the parties may address the Attorney General's recent
decision in Matter of Castillo-Perez, 27 I&N Dec. 664 (A.G. 2019) and its impact on the question
of whether the respondent is deserving of cancellation of removal as a purely discretionary matter.
See id. at 670-71.
