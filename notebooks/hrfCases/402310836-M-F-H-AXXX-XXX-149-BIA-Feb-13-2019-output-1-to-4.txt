IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Patricia Ojeda, Esquire
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
August 29, 2018, decision, denying his application for withholding of removal pursuant to
section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); and his request
for protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.13-.16.' The
appeal will be dismissed, in part, and sustained, in part; and the record will be remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.?
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues
de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
At the outset, we note that an Immigration Judge in these proceedings concluded that the
respondent was entitled to a qualified representative based on his membership in the class certified
in Franco-Gonzalez v. Holder, No. CV-10-02211 DMG (DTBx), 2014 WL 5475097 (C.D. Cal.
Oct. 29, 2014), along with additional procedural safeguards provided consistent with Matter of
M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474 (BIA 2011) (IJ at 2-4; Tr. at 5-22, 88-91, 139; Exhs. R8, R9, R10,
R11, 15). As a threshold matter, we note that the appointment of counsel and the implementation
of safeguards are not challenged by either party on appeal.
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's application for withholding of removal by
relying, generally, on the doctrine of res judicata (IJ at 4-6). In so doing, the Immigration Judge
noted that, in separate removal proceedings, an Immigration Judge denied withholding of removal
to this respondent on November 15, 2016, and we dismissed the resulting appeal on April 3, 2017
(IJ at 1-2). The respondent challenges the applicability of the res judicata doctrine and asserts that
the Immigration Judge should have considered the instant withholding application on the merits
(Respondent's Br. at 7-12).
! On appeal, the respondent does not dispute that he is ineligible for asylum pursuant to
section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, consistent with the Immigration Judge's decision (IJ at 2,
4-5; Respondent's Br. at 6; Tr. at 66-67). Therefore, that application for relief is not before us.
2 The respondent's fee waiver request is granted. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.8(e)(3).

Although the Immigration Judge did not discuss the basis of the prior denial in his
August 29, 2018, decision, the November 15, 2016, decision is contained in the record of
proceedings (August 29, 2018, Documentary Submission). Therein, an Immigration Judge found
the respondent had (1) sustained a May 13, 1998, conviction for transportation for sale of
marijuana under California Health & Safety Code § 11359, and (2) that the conviction qualified as
a particularly serious crimc under Matter of Y-L-, A-G., & R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002),
overruled on other grounds by Zheng v. Ashcrofi, 332 F.3d 1186, 1196 (9th Cir. 2003). See also
Guerrero v. Whitaker, 908 F.3d 541, 543 (9th Cir. 2018). In addition, the Immigration Judge
concluded that the respondent did not carry his burden of proof to demonstrate past persecution on
account of a protected ground by the Mexican government or anyone the government was unable
or unwilling to control. In our April 3, 2017, order, affirming the Immigration Judge's decision,
we explained that “The respondent's arguments on appeal do not persuade us of any legal or factual
error in the Immigration Judge's decision" (August 29, 2018, Documentary Submission).
We need not decide the application of res judicata as to withholding of removal generally but
only decide that the doctrine of res judicata should not be applied to bar reexamination of the
particularly serious crime question here, as there has been a change in law that has altered the
relevant particularly serious crime analysis (IJ at 5-6; Respondent’s Br. at 13, 17-21). See, e.g.,
Lopez-Bazante v. Gonzales, 237 F. App’x 131, 134 (9th Cir. 2007). Specifically, the Immigration
Judge in the November 15, 2016, decision properly relied on Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, & R-S-R-, in
concluding that the respondent's drug conviction was a presumptive particularly serious crime.
However, in 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the jurisdiction in
which this case arises, issued a published decision explaining that a respondent's mental health
condition at the time a crime is committed is a relevant factor in evaluating whether an offense is
particularly serious. See Gomez-Sanchez v. Sessions, 892 F.3d 985,996 (9th Cir. 2018).

Accordingly, where, as here, there is a determination that the respondent lacks competency to
proceed without procedural safeguards, we conclude that it is not appropriate for the Immigration
Judge to use res judicata principals in relying on a previously entered particularly serious crime
determination that does not take into account what, if any, impact the respondent's mental
condition had on his conviction, considering the intervening circuit case law.
Turning to the respondent's request for deferral of removal under the Convention Against
Torture, the respondent has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, with mild
neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury (IJ at 2-3; Tr. at 95-103; Exhs. 14B, 15A-B).
The respondent sustained the initial brain trauma in a car accident in 1989 but the injury was
exacerbated by additional falls, including one that occurred during his immigration detention,
further impairing his cognitive abilities (IJ at 3; Tr. at 99-101, 131-32; Exhs. 14B, 15A-B). As a
result, he expressed a fear of return to Mexico because, without structured medical care and family
supports, he was concerned that he would decompensate and come to the attention of authorities,
resulting in mistreatment rising to the level of torture should he be detained by authorities or
involuntarily hospitalized (IJ at 8-10; Tr. at 104, 106-08, 124-27, 134-38; Exhs. 11, 15A).

In denying the application for relief, the Immigration Judge found the respondent was not
previously tortured, or even harmed, in Mexico, and this finding is not challenged on appeal
(IJ at 7). 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c)(3)(i); 1208.18(a)(1), (2), (4). Notably, the respondent last resided
in Mexico in 2017 for 3 months, during which time he was not harmed or detained by police, nor
was he involuntarily hospitalized (IJ at 8-9; Tr. at 133-34). In the absence of evidence of past
mistreatment by or encounters with the police or psychiatric hospital staff, and considering the
background evidence regarding the conditions existing in Mexican mental health facilities, the
Immigration Judge concluded that there was an insufficient likelihood that the respondent would
detained or hospitalized in public institutions and then mistreated by authorized individuals who
held a specific intent to torture him (IJ at 9-10; Tr. at 102-03, 104, 106-08, 133-34; Exhs. R7, R8,
11, 15C).
On appeal, the respondent generally maintains that (1) without medication he would
decompensate and come to the attention of the authorities and (2) the record contains sufficient
background evidence to establish that hospital staff members often mistreat patients in Mexican
psychiatric hospitals with a specific intent harm them (Respondent's Br. at 22-24). Assuming,
arguendo, that the background evidence is sufficient to establish such individuals would act with
a specific intent to torture the respondent, should he be hospitalized, we discem no clear error in
the Immigration Judge's factual prediction that the respondent has not established, by a sufficient
likelihood, that he would be arrested and/or hospitalized in Mexico (IJ at 9-10). In so doing, we
note that, during his recent return to Mexico in 2017, the respondent had no interaction with any
police or public health officials and the record does not contain sufficient persuasive evidence
establishing a practice by Mexican police to target individuals similarly situated to the respondent
for arrest, detention, and/or hospitalization (IJ at 9-10; Tr. at 102-04, 106-08, 133-34; Exhs. R7,
R8, 11, 15C). See Matter of Z-2-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015); see also Vilug v. Holder,
723 F.3d 1056, 1066 (9th Cir. 2013). Thus, we will affirm the Immigration Judge's decision to
deny the respondent's request for such protection (IJ at 9-10).

for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is affirmed insofar as it relates to the respondent's
application for withholding of removal.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion and the entry of a new decision as it relates to the respondent's
