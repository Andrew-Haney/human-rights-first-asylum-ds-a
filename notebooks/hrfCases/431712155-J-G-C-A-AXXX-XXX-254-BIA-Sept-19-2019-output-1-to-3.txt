IN ASYLUM AND/OR WITHHOLDING PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:
Allison Boyle, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Joseph M. Lattanzio
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Remand; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The applicant appeals from a March 25, 2019, Immigration Judge decision denying the
applicant's requests for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture,
8 C.F.R. GS 1208.16(c), 1208.18 (2019).' We will remand the record for further proceedings.

This Board reviews the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including credibility findings,
for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (2019). We review all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.I(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent argues that her due process right to a full and fair removal hearing was violated,
and requests remand to a different Immigration Judge (Respondent's Br. at 1-21). As set forth in
Matter of Y-S-L-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2015), "a respondent in immigration proceedings
should expect dignity, respect, courtesy, and fairness in a hearing before an Immigration Judge.
Conduct by an Immigration Judge that can be perceived as bullying or hostile can have a chilling
effect on a respondent's testimony and thereby limit his or her ability to fully develop the facts of
the claim. Such behavior also creates the appearance that an Immigration Judge has abandoned his
or her role as a neutral fact-finder and raises a question whether the respondent was given a full
and fair hearing of his claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.
Moreover, the mere appearance of bias on the part of an Immigration Judge can diminish the
stature of the judicial process that he or she represents.” Matter of Y-S-L-C-, 26 I&N Dec. at 690-91
(remanding for a new hearing before a different Immigration Judge) (internal citations and
quotations omitted).
However, an Immigration Judge may be “short tempered" without violating due process;
judicial expressions of impatience or annoyance are not unconstitutional unless they derive from
The Immigration Judge refers to several documents from the applicant's 2008 proceedings that
are not in the record (IJ at 1-2). Exhibits 4B and 4C appear to have been inadvertently omitted
from the record.

an extrajudicial source or betray a level of deep-seated antagonism against the respondent that
would make fair judgment impossible. Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-56 (1994).
We conclude that a new hearing by a different Immigration Judge is warranted. A review of
the record indicates that the hearing raised concerns articulated in Matter of Y-S-L-C- Based on
concems raised by the respondent regarding commentary by the Immigration Judge that is
inappropriate (Respondent's Br. at 6-21, citing, e.g., Tr. at 1-2, 5-6, 22, 28-44, 57-58, 61-62, 66-
69, 71, 73, 86, 88-89, 94-99), given the totality of the circumstances, we will remand the record
for a new hearing before a different Immigration Judge. Matter of Y-S-L-C-, 26 I&N Dec. at 690-
91.
Accordingly, the following order will be issued.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Los Fresnos Immigration Court for further
proceedings consistent with this order, and for the entry of a new decision.
