In re:
1-B
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gloria Sarahi Echevarria, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Jennifer Riester
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION:
Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent is a 21-year-old native and citizen of Mexico. In a decision dated
July 28, 2017, an Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged, denied his
applications for asylum under section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1158, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3),
protection under the Convention Against Torture, and ordered him removed from the United States
to Mexico. The respondent appealed. The appeal will be sustained

The respondent testified that he obtained lawful permanent residence through his step-father,
and that he had been in Mexico for 3 days visiting family, and that he was fishing with friends in
Mexico when armed men, who he thought were members of the Zeta Cartel, stopped the
respondent and his friends because one of the respondent's friends was thought to have stolen
drugs (IJ at 4; Tr. at 85-91, 117-19). The respondent testified that he had never experienced any
problems in Mexico prior to this incident (IJ at 6; Tr. at 120). While the Zetas were kicking his
friend, the respondent was able to escape unhammed, and he crossed back into the United States,
and was charged with illegal entry (IJ at 5; Tr. at 93-101). The respondent testified that he fears
retum to Mexico because he believes that the Zetas want to kill him for whatever his friend stole
from them, and he also fears the government is involved with organized crime (IJ at 5;
Tr. at 120-21). He also fears retum due to an anti-gang imputed political opinion (Tr. at 142-43).
The Immigration Judge noted that the respondent admitted alienage and based on the record,
including the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien, she found the respondent removable as
charged (IJ at 8-9; Exhs. 1, 2; Tr. at 28, 79-80). The Immigration Judge found that the respondent
provided plausible and consistent testimony and that he was credible (IJ at 8). Further, the
Immigration Judge found that the mistreatment experienced by the respondent during his
altercation with the Zetas did not rise to the level of harm required to establish past persecution
(IJ at 10-12; see Arif v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 677, 680 (5th Cir. 2007) (noting persecution is an
extreme concept that does not include all treatment our society regards as offensive). In addition,
the Immigration Judge found that the respondent has not demonstrated that he suffered past
persecution or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of membership in
a particular social group, political opinion, or another protected ground under the Act, and that he
necessarily failed to establish his entitlement to withholding of removal (see IJ at 12-17, 21). See

441
section 208(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act; Thuri v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 788 (5th Cir. 2004) (finding that
conduct driven by criminal, non-political motives is not persecution on account of a protected
ground). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent had not demonstrated that “it is
more likely than not” he would be tortured if removed to Mexico (IJ at 22-24). See 8 C.F.R.
$ 1208.16(c)(2).
On appeal, the respondent contests removability and contends he should be exempted from
section 101(a)(13)(C)(vi) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(C)(vi), because he was forced to cross
into the United States at a place other than a port of entry in order to save his life (Respondent's
Brief at 5). We agree. We note that the respondent's involuntary reentry into the United States is
consistent with Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449 (1963); see Vartelas v. Holder, 566 U.S. 257
(2012). Inasmuch as the respondent is still a lawful permanent resident, the proceedings will be
terminated.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained and the proceedings are terminated.
