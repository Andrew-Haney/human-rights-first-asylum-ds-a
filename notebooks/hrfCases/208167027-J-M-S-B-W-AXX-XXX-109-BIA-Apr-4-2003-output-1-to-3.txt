RECI
ORDER:
D ㅉ
PER CURIAM. The respondent, a native of Zaire and a citizen of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (as Zaire was renamed), is appealing the May 26, 2000, decision of the Immigration Judge
denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3). The Immigration Judge also
denied his request for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.16. In addition, the Immigration Judge denied his request for voluntary departure under
section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The respondent's appeal fee waiver request is
granted. 8 C.F.R. & 1003.8(c). His request for oral argument is denied. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e). The
respondent's request for three-member review made pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(f) is also denied.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service (the “Service,” now the Department of Homeland
Security) has filed a brief in support of the Immigration Judge's decision.
The Immigration Judge declined to describe the respondent's testimony in detail, noting that “the
transcript should suffice to show what the testimony and arguments were in this case” (1.J. at 4). The
Immigration Judge ultimately determined that the respondent presented a fabricated claim of
persecution.
Because the Immigration Judge declined to state the facts of the case, it is difficult to discem the
nature of the respondent's claim from a review of the Immigration Judge's decision. We find that

109
it is important for the Immigration Judge to make findings regarding the relevant facts of the case.
This is particularly so in the instant case where, as noted by the Service in its appeal brief, “many
of the facts of this case [] are in dispute.” Service's Appeal Brief at 1. In addition, we believe that
complete factual findings are especially important when an Immigration Judge determines that an
alien knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application.
Accordingly, we find that the record should be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
factual findings. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (stating that it is especially
important in light of new regulations for Immigration Judges to include in their decisions clear and
complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling
law). The Immigration Judge may further consider the validity (or lack thereof) of the respondent's
documents in light of the arguments raised by the respondent concerning the propriety of relying
upon information about the documents provided by the government of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. Respondent's Appeal Brief at 13-16, 19-23.
In light of the foregoing, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
consideration of the respondent's claim. On remand, the parties should be afforded an opportunity
to present additional evidence, including further testimony and updated country conditions, relevant
to the respondent's application for asylum and withholding of removal, as well as his request for
protection under the Convention Against Torture. In addition, the respondent should be provided
an opportunity to apply for any other relief from removal for which he currently may be eligible.
Accordingly, the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
