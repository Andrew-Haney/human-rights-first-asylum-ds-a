IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Brian D. O'Neill, Esquire
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; cancellation of removal
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Gambia, appeals from an Immigration Judge's
February 8, 2018, decision denying her applications for withholding of removal under section
241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); protection pursuant
to the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. S$ 1208.16(c)-1208.18, and cancellation of removal
under section 240A(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 12296(b). The appeal will be sustained and the
record will be remanded.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
This Board reviews the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including credibility findings
and predictions as to the likelihood of future events, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
We review all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent claims that she suffered past persecution in the form of female genital
mutilation (“FGM”) (Exh. 3). Additionally, the respondent asserts a clear probability of future
persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group related to her diagnosis with
HIV, which she contracted from her second husband from an arranged marriage (Exh. 3). The
respondent further avers that if forced to return to the Gambia, she will be unable to stop her
United States citizen daughter from undergoing FGM (Exh. 3).
In assessing the respondent's credibility, the Immigration Judge found that she offered little
testimony regarding her claim that she was forced to marry her second husband (1) at 2, 9-10; Tr. at
30-34). The Immigration Judge further determined that the respondent's claim of a forced
marriage was undermined by the fact that she waited about 10 years after her arrival in the
United States to raise this claim in an amended asylum application, after omitting it from her initial
asylum application (1) at 10; Tr. at 47; Exhs. 2-3). In addition, the Immigration Judge found that
the respondent never told an asylum officer about her forced marriage during an asylum interview
| The respondent has not challenged the Immigration Judge's ruling that she is subject to the
asylum time bar of section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), and she has not
established eligibility for an exception to the time bar (1) at 8-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(i),
(a)(4), (a)(5). We therefore hold that this issue has been waived on appeal. See Muller of R-A-M-,
25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012).

(1J at 10; Tr. at 47-48). Finally, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent's testimony
that her United States citizen daughter traveled to Senegal was inconsistent with her asylum
statement, which provides that her daughter went to the Gambia (IJ at 10; Tr. at 55-59, 97-99; Exh.
3). For these reasons, the Immigration Judge “did not find the respondent to be a credible witness”
(1J at 10)
We do not understand the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility finding conceming the
respondent's arranged marriage to extend to her testimony that she was forced to endure FGM
(IJ at 10). In this regard, rather than denying the respondent's FGM claim on credibility grounds,
the Immigration Judge provided several reasons in support of his conclusion that the respondent
had not met her burden of proof (IJ at 10-11). For the following reasons, we reverse the
Immigration Judge's burden of proof ruling.
As corroborating evidence of her testimony that she was forced to undergo FGM, the
respondent presented an examination record from a medical doctor in the United States
(Exh. 5, Tab K; Respondent's Br. at 1). We disagree with the Immigration Judge's conclusion that
this examination record is entitled to limited weight because it describes the results of a “routine"
examination and it was prepared for the purpose of litigation (IJ at 10). The respondent properly
obtained the examination report to demonstrate that she had undergone FGM given her burden of
presenting reasonably available corroborating evidence. See section 240(c)(4)(B) of the Act,
8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(B). Further, we conclude that the Immigration Judge erroneously found
that the report establishes that the respondent's FGM is a "new problem,” as there is no indication
that the procedure was inflicted upon the respondent after she left the Gambia for the United States
(IJ at 10). Also, even if the respondent had not previously sought treatment in this country for
complications arising from FGM (IJ at 10), that would not be dispositive of her FGM claim under
goveming precedent. The Immigration Judge properly determined that the respondent
inaccurately told the doctor that she had never been diagnosed with HIV (IJ at 10-11; Exh. 5, Tab K
at 109), and her statement that she suffered FGM when she was 10 years old was inconsistent with
her testimony that it happened when she was 17 (IJ at 11; Tr. at 40; Exh. 5, Tab K at 107).
Nevertheless, the examination record does corroborate the respondent's testimony that she
underwent FGM in the Gambia (Tr. at 40, 43, 63; Exh. 5, Tab K at 107). Therefore, we conclude
that the respondent has demonstrated that she suffered past harm which was sufficiently egregious
to constitute persecution. See Bah v. Mukasey, 529 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of A-T-,
25 I&N Dec. 4, 10-11 (BIA 2009).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Immigration Judge did not determine whether the respondent showed that she suffered
this harm on account of a protected ground. Therefore, we will remand the record for relevant
fact-finding in accordance with Matter of A-T-. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating that the
Board may remand when additional fact-finding is required in a given case); Malter of A-B-,
27 I&N Dec. 316, 343 (A.G. 2018) (the motive of a persecutor is a factual question, and thus an
Immigration Judge's findings with respect to that question are entitled to deference on appeal and
may be reversed only if clearly erroneous); Mailer of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526, 532 (BIA 2011)
(same).
The Immigration Judge also concluded that the objective reasonableness of the respondent's
fear of future persecution is undercut by the passage of laws in the Gambia making FGM illegal
Cite as: J-J-, AXXX XXX 286 (BIA Oct. 23, 2019)
-686
(IJ at 11). However, if the respondent demonstrates a “nexus” to a protected ground, it would then
be presumed that she has a clear probability of future persecution on the same basis of the original
claim and the burden would shift to the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to rebut this
presumption by establishing either a fundamental change in circumstances or that the respondent
could reasonably avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the Gambia. See
8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i)-(ii). Thus, the Immigration Judge should reconsider his objective
reasonableness ruling on remand, shifting the burden of proof to the DHS if warranted.?
Turning to the respondent's application for cancellation of removal, the Immigration Judge
concluded that the respondent had not shown that her removal would cause exceptional and
extremely unusual hardship to her United States citizen daughter, who is her qualifying relative
under section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act (IJ at 12-13). In this regard, the Immigration Judge found
that the respondent did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence, such as affidavits from other
family members who have undergone FGM, of her claim that her family members in the Gambia
want to subject her daughter to FGM (IJ at 13). The Immigration Judge further determined that
the respondent presented insufficient corroborating evidence of her claim that she will be unable
to obtain treatment for HIV in the Gambia (IJ at 13). Furthermore, the Immigration Judge found
that the respondent's daughter is healthy, and the economic detriment and emotional hardship that
she would suffer in the event of the respondent's removal did not rise to the level of exceptional
and extremely unusual hardship (IJ at 13).
On appeal, the respondent notes that she testified that she would be isolated in the Gambia
because her HIV-positive status would cause her to be viewed by others (including her family) as
a threat to them, and she would lack access to medication (Tr. at 38, 45, 63-64, 75-77, 80;
Respondent's Br. at 2). Along these lines, the respondent identifies background evidence she
submitted describing societal discrimination against and mistreatment by the govemment of
persons with HIV/AIDS in the Gambia (Exh. 5, Tabs N-Q; Respondent's Br. at 1). The respondent
also submitted the opinion of an expert witness regarding the social and economic consequences
that the respondent's HIV-positive status would have on her in the Gambia (Respondent’s Br. at
4-5; Exh. 5, Tab U). We agree with the respondent that the Immigration Judge erroneously
overlooked this evidence (IJ at 13; Respondent's Br. at 4, 7-8).

Specifically, while hardship to the respondent herself does not provide a basis for satisfying
section 240A(b)(1)(D) of the Act, it is relevant in deciding whether the hardship that the
respondent's qualifying relative will experience in the Gambia or while remaining in the

On the other hand, the Immigration Judge was correct in ruling that the respondent may not
qualify for withholding of removal based on her fear of her United States citizen daughter being
forced to undergo FGM (IJ at 10). See Maller of A-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 275 (BIA 2007).

As the respondent observes on appeal, she has presented corroborating evidence of her testimony
that she has been diagnosed with and treated for HIV in this country (Tr. at 34-36, 45-46, 60, 67-68;
Exh. 5, Tabs E-F, M; Respondent's Br. at 5-6). Considering this evidence and the Immigration
Judge's acknowledgement that the respondent has HIV in his cancellation of removal analysis
(IJ at 13), we conclude that the respondent's HIV-positive status is not a contested issue of fact.

United States rises to the level of “exceptional and extremely unusual” (Respondent's Br. at 8). It
is thus necessary on remand for the Immigration Judge to evaluate this evidence, make relevant
fact-findings, and newly decide whether the respondent has met her burden of proving that her
removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. See
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).
Lastly, the Immigration Judge did not address the respondent's claim that she is eligible for
withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture due to her
membership in a particular social group related to her HIV-positive status (Exh. 3). On remand,
the Immigration Judge should do so in the first instance.
The Immigration Judge may take whatever steps he deems necessary to comply with our order.
We express no opinion regarding the ultimate outcome of the case.
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the record is remanded for further proceedings and the
entry of a new decision consistent with this opinion.

In re:
a.k.a.
DISSENTING OPINION: Earle B. Wilson, Appellate Immigration Judge
I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision. I agree with the majority's determination
that the Immigration Judge “did not find the respondent to be a credible witness.” However, rather
than proceeding based on the “understanding)” that the adverse credibility finding did not extend
to the issue of whether the respondent was subjected to undergo a forced FGM procedure, I would
remand for the Immigration Judge to clarify, in the first instance, whether the respondent presented
credible testimony and evidence concerning her FGM claim. See IJ at 10-11 (expressing concern
regarding the medical records submitted by the respondent and her inconsistent statements
regarding her age when the FGM procedure was performed). Pending such a ruling, it is premature
to decide whether the respondent has established past persecution in the form of FGM.
On the other hand, I agree with the majority's decision regarding the need for further
fact-finding and analysis concerning the respondent's burden of demonstrating that her removal
would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her qualifying relative under section
240A(b)(1)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 12296(b)(1)(D). Likewise, I
concur that it is necessary for the Immigration Judge to address in the first instance the
respondent's claim that she qualifies for withholding of removal and protection pursuant to the
Convention Against Torture in connection with her HIV-positive status.
