IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
APPLICATION: Asylum
The respondents appeal from the Immigration Judge's June 19, 2017, decision finding that the
lead respondent abandoned her application for asylum, and ordering the respondents removed to
El Salvador.' The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) did not respond to the appeal. The
appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded for further proceedings and the entry of
a new decision.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
At the group master calendar hearing held on March 1, 2017, the Immigration Judge provided
the respondent with a Form I-589 application for relief, advised the respondent that her application
must be filed by the next hearing on June 19, 2017, and gave her a scheduling order that instructed
her on how to apply for relief. The scheduling order contained a warning that if the application
and supporting documents were not filed as directed by the next scheduled hearing, the
respondent's opportunity to file for asylum or withholding of removal would be waived (IJ at 1-2;
Tr. at 6, 11-12; Scheduling Order Govering Asylum Applications Before the (Immigration
Judge) (Scheduling Order)). On June 19, 2017, the respondent appeared in Immigration Court,
stated that she feared returning to El Salvador, and indicated that she had not yet prepared her
asylum application for filing in Court (Tr. at 20). The respondent testified that she did not fill out
the application because it is in English and she did not understand it (Id.). She indicated that she
sought the assistance of three different attorneys but they did not want to help her (Id.). The
Immigration Judge inquired as to whether the DHS opposed a continuance in this case. The DHS

The respondents are a mother and her minor children. The mother is the lead respondent. Her
children are derivative applicants on her application for asylum. References to the singular
respondent refer to the lead respondent.

did not oppose a short continuance. However, the DHS acknowledged that “when you issue a
scheduling order and they (do not] meet it, you have every right to proceed and not to continue the
case” (Id.). The Immigration Judge did not find "good cause for a continuance of these
proceedings,” deemed the respondent's application for asylum abandoned, and ordered her
removed from the United States (IJ at 2).
An Immigration Judge may “set and extend time limits for the filing of applications and,” when
applications are not filed within those time limits, the opportunity to file them “shall be deemed
waived." 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c). The Board has long held that applications for benefits under the
Act are properly denied as abandoned when the alien fails to file them in a timely manner after
having been provided a fair opportunity to do so. See Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 549
(BIA 1992); Matter of Jean, 17 I&N Dec. 100, 102 (BIA 1979).

Here, however, we consider that the respondent testified that despite her good faith efforts,
three attomeys declined to assist her, the DHS had already agreed to a short continuance, and no
prior continuance had been granted. Matter of L-A-B-R-, 27 I&N Dec. 405, 413 (A.G. 2018);
8 C.F.R. § 1003.29. Under the circumstances presented, we conclude there was good cause for a
continuance. Matter of Perez-Andrade, 19 I&N Dec. 433, 434 (BIA 1987). We will remand the
record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondent an opportunity to submit her asylum
application. We caution the respondent that delay in filing any application for relief may result in
a finding that relief has been abandoned.
Accordingly the following orders will be entered.

ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FUTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.
