IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Ellis C. Baggs, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Nicole I. Schroeder
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal
The respondent is a native and citizen of Honduras. On September 27, 2018, the Immigration
Judge denied the respondent's application for asylum under section 208(b) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b), but granted his application for withholding of removal under
section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).' The respondent appeals from the
Immigration Judge's denial of asylum, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appeals
from the Immigration Judge's grant of withholding of removal. The respondent's request for oral
argument is denied. The record will be remanded.

We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of 2-2-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review questions
of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that he did
not establish changed circumstances excusing the untimely filing of his asylum application. On
cross-appeal, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that the respondent
established his eligibility for withholding of removal. Specifically, the DHS argues that the
Immigration Judge exceeded her authority by redefining the respondent's particular social group.
The DHS also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that the respondent
established past persecution and a clear probability of persecution on account of his membership
in the particular social group consisting of “property owners who refuse to cooperate with gangs.”
Turning first to the respondent's appeal, we disagree with the Immigration Judge's
determination that the respondent did not establish changed circumstances excusing the untimely
filing of his asylum application (IJ at 6-7). An alien applying for asylum must demonstrate “by
clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the
The Immigration Judge determined that it was unnecessary to address whether the respondent
established cligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture or voluntary departure
(IJ 13).

alien's arrival in the United States,” or April 1, 1997, whichever is later. See section 208(a)(2)(B)
of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2). An application for asylum may be considered even if it is filed
more than 1 year after the date of the alien's arrival in the United States, if the alien demonstrates
“either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant's eligibility
for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing" the application. See
section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act. The applicant shall file asylum application within a reasonable
period given those "changed circumstances.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(ii).

In this case, the respondent was admitted to the United States on June 19, 2011, but did not file
his asylum application until March 8, 2016 (IJ at 6). The respondent contends that recent threats
to his family, worsening conditions in Honduras, and the deaths of two of his family members
constitute changed circumstances excusing the untimely filing of his asylum application. In her
September 27, 2018, decision, the Immigration Judge determined that these circumstances do not
constitute changed circumstances for purposes of excusing the respondent's untimely filing
because they arose after the respondent filed his application for relief (IJ at 6-7). Cf. Zambrano v.
Sessions, 878 F.3d 84 (4th Cir. 2017) (holding that the intensification of circumstances arising
before the filing of an untimely asylum application can constitute changed circumstances).
However, we agree with the respondent's argument on appeal that changed circumstances need
not occur before the asylum application is filed. Indeed, legislative history demonstrates that
Congress' intent in creating the changed circumstances exception was to “ensur(e) that those with
legitimate claims of asylum are not returned to persecution, particularly for technical deficiencies.”
142 Cong. Rec. S11838-40 (statement of Sen. Hatch). Here, the Immigration Judge granted the
respondent's application for withholding of removal in part due to the evidence of changed
circumstances, and the Immigration Judge assumed that this evidence materially affects the
respondent's eligibility for relief. See Respondent's Br. at 2 (citing IJ at 6-7).

Moreover, neither the statute nor the regulation mandates that the changed circumstances must
occur before the application is filed. Indeed, as argued by the respondent on appeal, the regulation
states that the applicant shall file “within a reasonable period given those changed
circumstances, not that the applicant shall file the application after the changed circumstances
(Respondent's Br. at 5). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.04(a)(4)(ii). We note that a finding that changed
circumstances can only occur before an untimely asylum application is filed would predicate an
alien's asylum eligibility on the mere fortuitousness of when the changed circumstances occur. In
this respect, if the changed circumstances occurred after an Immigration Judge's final order, an
alien would be eligible for asylum through a motion to reopen, but if they occurred before the
Immigration Judge's final order, as is the case here, then the alien would be ineligible for asylum.
We conclude that such a ruling would be arbitrary and m, as well as difficult to reconcile
with the congressional intent behind the 1-year exception, as aforementioned. We also agree with
the respondent's contention on appeal that such a ruling would have the practical effect of
encouraging asylum applicants who have filed an untimely application to file another application
in proceedings each and every time a possible change in circumstances has occurred, given that
the Immigration Judge could find the previous changed circumstance not to be material, which is
an illogical result.
Turning next to the DHS's cross-appeal, we find no clear error in the Immigration Judge's
finding that the government of Honduras is unable or unwilling to protect the respondent from

gang members (IJ at 8-9). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (clear error standard of review); see also
Malter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 320, 337-38, 343-44 (A.G. 2018); Master of McMullen,
17 I&N Dec. 542, 544-45 (BIA 1980); Malter of Pierre, 15 I&N Dec. 461, 462 (BIA 1975). As
found by the Immigration Judge, the respondent testified that he attempted to report some of his
harm to the police, but the police informed him that they could not do anything to help him (IJ
at 8; Tr. at 35). Moreover, the background evidence reveals that Honduras suffered from
significant human rights abuses during the time in which the respondent was harmed, as well as
police corruption (IJ at 8; Exhs. 6R-X, 8). Although the DHS argues on appeal that there is
evidence that the government of Honduras has made efforts to combat corruption and gang
violence, this evidence is insufficient to find clear error in the Immigration Judge's finding that
the government of Honduras is unable or unwilling to protect the respondent (Exhs. 5, 6, 7A, D-F).
We disagree, however, with the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent
established his eligibility for withholding of removal on the basis of his land ownership (IJ at 7-13).
Specifically, even if the Immigration Judge was permitted to redefine the respondent's particular
social group as “property owners who refuse to cooperate with gangs,” rather than simply
“property owners,” we disagree with the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent
established that this proposed particular social group is cognizable. In this regard, contrary to the
Immigration Judge, we conclude that this group fails the particularity test because many people
own different types of property in Honduras, which they use for divergent purposes (IJ at 11). See
Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208, 213-15 (BIA 2014), remanded on other grounds by Reyes v.
Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016); Malter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 239-40 (BIA 2014);
see also Pantoja-Medrano v. Holder, 520 F. App'x 147 (4th Cir. 2013) (holding that the proposed
social group of individuals believed to have acted as govemment informants against members of
a drug distribution conspiracy lacked the requisite particularity). We also disagree with the
Immigration Judge that the respondent identified sufficient evidence to satisfy the social
distinction requirement (IJ at 11-12). See Maller of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 215-18; Malter of
M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 240-43. Instead, the respondent's fear appears to be based on general
crime and conditions of violence, which does not constitute a basis for relief. See Malter of
Sanchez and Escobar, 19 I&N Dec. 276, 284-86 (BIA 1985), aſſd sub nom. Sanchez Trujillo v.
INS, 801 F.2d 1571 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that an alien's fear of general conditions of violence
and civil unrest does not constitute a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the
Act); see also Master of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 335 (stating that social groups defined by their
vulnerability to private criminal activity likely lack the requisite particularity).

Because the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was eligible for withholding of
removal based on the aforementioned reasons, she found it unnecessary to address whether the
respondent established his eligibility for relief based on his family membership. We therefore
conclude that remand of the record is warranted for the Immigration Judge to determine whether
the respondent established his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of
his family membership.? Upon remand, the Immigration Judge should also determine in the first

FOR THE BOARD
Temporary Board Member Teresa L. Donovan respectfully dissents from the majority's
determination that “changed circumstances” that trigger the exception to the 1-year time limit for
filing an asylum application may post-date the asylum application. I interpret sections
208(a)(2)(B) and (D) of the Act as requiring that the “changed circumstances” predate the
asylum application.
