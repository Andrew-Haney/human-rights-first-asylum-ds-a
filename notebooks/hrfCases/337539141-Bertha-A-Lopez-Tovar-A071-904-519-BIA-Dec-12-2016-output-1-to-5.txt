IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Kathryn E. Staples, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Elly Laff
Assistant Chief Counsel
CHARGE:
Notice: Sec. 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)] -
Convicted of aggravated felony
Sec. 237(a)(2)(B)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)] -
Convicted of controlled substance violation

APPLICATION: Termination of proceedings
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge's March 29, 2016, decision finding her
removable as charged and denying her applications for asylum and withholding of removal
under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158 and
1231(b)(3), and for protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. 88 1208.16-.18
(2016). The appeal will be sustained, and the proceedings will be terminated.
In her decision, the Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged based on
her December 14, 2012, conviction for the offense of attempted possession of a dangerous drug
for sale in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes sections 13-3407 (I.J. at 12-15; Exh. 4). In
particular, the respondent conceded her removability for a controlled substances offense under
section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (I.J. at 12). Further, although not
specifically stated, it appears the Immigration Judge utilized Descamps v. United States,
133 S.Ct. 2276 (2013), to find the statute divisible, and then applied the modified categorical
approach to find the respondent's conviction to be an aggravated felony under sections
101(a)(43)(B) and (U) of the Act rendering her removable under section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the
Act (I.J. at 13-14). The Immigration Judge also denied all of the respondent's applications for
relief. The respondent has appealed. We find that the respondent's conviction under Arizona
Revised Statutes section 13-3407 does not render her removable either for an aggravated felony
as defined by section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act or for a controlled substances offense under
section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, and the proceedings therefore must be terminated.

A071 904 519,
In particular, subsequent to the Immigration Judge's decision in this case, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where this case arises, held that Arizona Revised Statutes
section 13-3408 is not divisible but, rather, is “overbroad” due to Arizona's regulation of two
substances not on the Federal Controlled Substance Schedule.' See Vera-Valdevinos v. Lynch,
649 F.App’x 597 (9th Cir. May 11, 2016). Specifically, the Ninth Circuit found section 13–3408
indivisible because Arizona's jury instructions do not require the jury to make a finding of fact
regarding the specific substance at issue. See id. at 598 n. 1; see also Lopez-Valencia v. Lynch,
798 F.3d 863, 869 (9th Cir. 2015) (“[A] statute is indivisible if the jury may disagree on the fact
at issue yet still convict."); Rev. Ariz. Jury Instructions (Criminal), 34.0871 (3d ed.). The Ninth
Circuit further found that a violation of section 13-3408 is neither a categorical “controlled
substances violation” nor a categorical “drug trafficking aggravated felony” under section
101(a)(43)(B) of the Act and that the modified categorical approach does not apply. See Vera-
Valdevinos v. Lynch, supra, at 598.
It is not disputed that Arizona's definition of "dangerous drug” is categorically broader than
the federal definition of “controlled substance” (I.J. at 12). See Alvarado v. Holder, 759 F.3d
1121, 1130 (9th Cir. 2014). As with section 13-3408, Arizona's jury instructions for Arizona
Revised Statutes section 13-3407 also do not require the jury to make a finding of fact regarding
the specific substance at issue. See Rev. Ariz. Jury Instructions (Criminal), 34.072 (3d ed.).
Thus, section 13-3407 also appears to be “overbroad” and not amenable to the modified
categorical approach. Therefore, the respondent's conviction under section 13-3407 does not
render her removable under either section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) or (B)(i) of the Act? See id.

Finally, we note that the respondent was also convicted for the offense of possession of drug
paraphemalia in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes section 13-3415(A) (Exbs. 3, 11A, 11B).
The record of conviction reflects that the respondent's conviction related to possession of

The Immigration Judge also noted this in her decision (I.J. at 12).

Subsequent to Descamps, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Mathis v. United States,
136 S.Ct. 2243 (2016), wherein it clarified its divisibility analysis in Descamps. The Supreme
Court's decision in Mathis is consistent with the Ninth Circuit's post-Descamps decision in
Rendon v. Holder, 764 F.3d 1077 (9th Cir. 2014), to which the Immigration Judge refered in her
decision (I.J. at 13). See id. ("[T]he Supreme Court regards elements (of an offense) as those
circumstances on which the jury must unanimously agree.”). Thus, the Supreme Court's
decision in Mathis does not affect the divisibility analysis in this instance.
We also note that, prior to the Supreme Court's decisions in Descamps and Mathis, and its own
decision in Rendon, the Ninth Circuit held, in an unpublished decision, that section 13-3407(A)
of the Arizona Revised Statutes is divisible such that the modified categorical approach can be
applied. See Banda-Montoya v. Holder, 446 F.App'x 920, 922 (9th Cir. 2011). The Ninth
Circuit has not explicitly withdrawn from its decision in Banda-Montoya. However, it also did
not have the benefit of the Supreme Court's guidance on the issue of divisibility when it made
that decision. Given when it was decided and the fact that it is not published precedent, we do
not find the decision in Banda-Montoya binding.

“baggies and (a) pipe.” However, in order for a conviction for possession of drug paraphemalia
to render an alien removable under section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, an element of the
conviction must be connected to a drug defined in the Controlled Substances Act. See Mellouli
v. Lynch, 135 S.Ct. 1980 (2015). That is not the case here. Therefore, we also find the
respondent's conviction under section 13-3415(A) does not render her removable from the
United States,
Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, and the proceedings will be terminated.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the proceedings are terminated.
