APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondents, natives and citizens of Honduras, appeal from the Immigration Judge's
July 1, 2015, decision denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture.' See sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). The
appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.
We review an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including findings regarding witness
credibility and what is likely to happen to the respondent, under a "clearly erroneous” standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all
other issues, including questions of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The respondents' applications were filed after May 11, 2005, and
therefore are governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act. Matter of S-B-, 24 I&N Dec. 42
(BIA 2006).

Due to the circumstances presented in this case, and to resolve any issue regarding jurisdiction
in this case, we will adjudicate the instant appeal in the exercise of our certification authority.
See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c).

A206 715 381 et al.
The lead respondent is the mother of the two minor respondents. The respondent claims her
former boyfriend, the father of her daughter, abused her and will abuse her again if she returns to
Honduras because of her membership in a particular social group which she defined as “women
who are victims of domestic violence in a relationship she cannot leave” (I.J. at 8; Tr. at 16).
She also defined her particular social group as "women who cannot leave a relationship” (Tr. at
52).
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not establish her eligibility for asylum
under section 208 of the Act. She found that the respondent suffered harm that rose to the level
of persecution, but concluded that the respondent's proposed group defined as “women who are
victims of domestic violence in a relationship she cannot leave,” was not a cognizable particular
social group (I.J. at 8-11). Alternatively, the Immigration Judge found that even if the
respondent defined a cognizable particular social group, she did not establish that the Honduran
government was unwilling or unable to control the persecutor in this case (1.J. at 11). The
Immigration Judge also found that the respondent did not present available corroborative
evidence such as medical records to document her past persecution (I.J. at 11).
We agree with the Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent suffered harm that rises
to the level of persecution (I.J. at 8). We also agree with the Immigration Judge that the group
defined as “women who are victims of domestic violence in a relationship she cannot leave,” is
not a cognizable particular social group insofar as it is defined solely by the risk of persecution
(I.J. at 10-11). See Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 388, 393 n.14 (BIA 2014); Matter of W-G-
R., 26 I&N Dec. 208, 215 (BIA 2014) (“Persecutory conduct aimed at a social group cannot
alone define the group, which must exist independently of the persecution.").
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
However, we agree with the respondent's appellate argument that the Immigration Judge did
not consider another group she proposed, namely, “women who cannot leave a relationship” (Tr.
at 52). See Respondent's Brief at 6-8. We agree with the respondent that this proposed group is
a cognizable particular social group and that she is a member of that group.
The Board recently clarified the elements required to establish a cognizable particular social
group. See Matter of W-G-R-, supra; see also Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA
2014). An applicant for asylum or withholding of removal based on membership in a particular
social group must establish that the group 1) is composed of members who share a common
immutable characteristic, 2) is defined with particularity, and 3) is socially distinct within the
society in question. See Matter of W-G-R-, supra, at 212-18; Matter of M-E-V-G-, supra, at 237.
We also recently held that depending on the facts and evidence in an individual case, victims of
domestic violence can establish membership in a particular social group that forms the basis of a
claim for asylum. Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra. In that case, we held that under the facts and
evidence, “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship” was a
cognizable particular social group.

We will refer to the lead respondent as “the respondent.” The minor respondents are
derivatives of their mother's asylum application. See section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act.

A206 715 381 et al.
The respondent's proposed group defined as “women who cannot leave a relationship” is
composed of members who share the common immutable characteristic of gender. Matter of A-
R-C-G-, supra, at 392. To satisfy the particularity requirement, a group must be discrete and
have definable boundaries. See Matter of W-G-R-, supra, at 214. The respondent's proposed
group is defined by terms that make it sufficiently particular in the society, i.e., “women,"
"relationship,” and “cannot leave.” Social distinction (formerly known as social visibility)
means that the group must be perceived as a group by society, regardless of whether society can
identify the members of the group by sight. Id. at 216-17. To demonstrate social distinction, an
applicant must provide evidence showing that society in general perceives, considers, or
recognizes persons sharing the particular characteristic to be a group. Id. at 217 (“Although the
society in question need not be able to easily identify who is a member of the group, it must be
commonly recognized that the shared characteristic is one that defines the group."). In this case,
the evidence of record, including the country conditions documentation, establishes that the
group is socially distinct in the society (Exh. 4, Tab J; Exh. 6, Tab E; Exh. 7 at 21).
Additionally, we do not agree with other aspects of the Immigration Judge's particular social
group analysis including her assertion that the respondent's group was not cognizable because
she was not married to the abuser and because her relationship was of a short duration (I.J. at 10).
See Respondent's Brief at 10-12. In Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra, we reasoned that marital status
could be an immutable characteristic depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, but
we did not require that a victim of domestic violence be married to the abuser. Nor did we
require that the victim of domestic violence be in a lengthy relationship with the abuser. In this
case, the respondent's relationship to the perpetrator is shown by the fact that they have a child
together. Also, the Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent was able to leave the
perpetrator is clearly erroneous (I.J. at 10-11). See Respondent's Brief at 8-10. The respondent
testified that although she lived apart from her boyfriend, he regularly came to her residence to
threaten and terrorize her (Tr. at 47-49).

We also disagree with the Immigration Judge's determination that the Honduran government
is unable or unwilling to protect the respondent from the abuser (I.J. at 11). The Immigration
Judge found that the respondent did not seek the help that was available to her (I.J. at 11). Yet,
the record contains copies of police reports showing that the respondent sought the protection of
law enforcement (Exh. 4, Tab D). The respondent credibly testified that the police told her to
file another report when the abuser was released from prison. She did not file such a report
because she left the country before he was released (Tr. at 23, 36-28; Exh. 4, Tab D). The
respondent, who attempted unsuccessfully to relocate to northern Honduras, showed that internal
relocation was not reasonable (Tr. at 38-39). See Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 28 (BIA
2012).
Finally, in reaching her decision, the Immigration Judge did not fully consider the
background documentation. While the Immigration Judge correctly found that Honduras has
enacted laws and established programs to assist victims of domestic violence, the country
condition documentation shows that domestic violence remains a widespread problem and
women are reluctant to lodge a complaint (Exh. 4, Tab J; Exh. 6, Tab E; Exh. 7 at 21). Based on
the totality of evidence of record, we conclude that the respondent is eligible for asylum.
