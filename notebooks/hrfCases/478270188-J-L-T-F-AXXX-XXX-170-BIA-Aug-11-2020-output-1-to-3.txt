In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Rebecca Medina, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
June 28, 2018, decision denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal under
sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158
& 1231(b)(3), and for protection under the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16-
1208.18. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for the entry of a new decision.
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

We conclude that it is necessary to remand the record for further analysis and for the entry of
a new decision. During proceedings below, the respondent stated that he fears persecution on
account of membership in a particular social group that he defined as “El Salvadorian men who
refuse to pay extortion money to gangs” (Tr. at 7). On appeal, the respondent correctly argues that
the Immigration Judge erred in adding an additional clause to his proposed particular social group.
The Immigration Judge identified the proposed group as “Salvadorian men who refuse to pay
extortion money to gangs and, as a consequence, run into threats and risks of violence from gangs"
(IJ at 3) (additional language italicized). The respondent further argues that this additional clause,
which was not part of the respondent's original definition, provided support for the Immigration
Judge's conclusion that the proposed particular social group is not cognizable because it is
circularly defined by the experience or risk of harm (IJ at On remand, the Immigration Judge
should therefore analyze the respondent's claim based on the proposed particular social group that
was initially set forth by the respondent.
We also conclude that the Immigration Judge's June 28, 2018, decision contains insufficient
findings of fact for our review. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). The
Immigration Judge properly noted significant precedent, including the Attorney General's decision
in Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018). However, the Immigration Judge's decision is
conclusory in stating the respondent is ineligible for relief based on recent precedent without
having made clear findings of fact. On remand, the Immigration Judge should therefore make
clear findings of fact and accompanying conclusions of law in adjudicating the respondent's
applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against
Torture. We express no opinion as to the outcome of that analysis.
