In re: Joan Arturo CASTILLO a.k.a. Joan Arturo Castillo Montiel
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Martha Liliana Arias, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Amanda J. Brown
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Reconsideration; reopening
The respondent appeals the Immigration Judge's decision dated February 28, 2018, denying
his motion to reconsider and reopen his proceedings. The record will be remanded.
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

In denying the motion, the Immigration Judge used a fom order which did not adequately
identify the reasons for denying the respondent's motion. The Immigration Judge noted on the
form order the following: “See Order of January 16, 2018, no new law or fact warrant
(reconsideration).” Without adequate explanation of the reasons for the Immigration Judge's
decision, the Board is not meaningfully able to review the appeal. See Matter of M-P-, 20 I&N
Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (holding that when a motion to reopen proceedings is denied, the
Immigration Judge must identify and fully explain the reasons for such decision); see also Matter
of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999). Specifically, after reviewing the Immigration Judge's
January 16, 2018, order, and the respondent's motion, we are unable to adjudicate the respondent's
appeal.
Further, after reviewing the audio recording of the last hearing, it appears that a “call-up” date
was scheduled for May 15, 2017, to submit a brief addressing the respondent's eligibility for relief
under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationlity Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H).
There is no specific form to be filed or filing fee for a section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver, and thus, it is
not clear which application for relief the Immigration Judge was referring to as missing from the
record in his January 16, 2018, decision.
In addition, on the May 15, 2017, call-up date, the respondent's counsel at the time, Ms.
Melisa Pena, filed a motion to withdraw as attomey of record, but did not file the promised brief
(May 15, 2017, “Motion to Withdraw as Attomey of Record”). In her motion, Ms. Pena did not
accurately explain that the call-up date was for filing her brief on behalf of the respondent; instead,

A099-240-709
she stated that the respondent was not cooperating or providing necessary documentation for his
defense, and they had “irreconcilable differences” (Id.).
In addition, it is not clear if the Immigration Judge was also considering the respondent's
applications for relief as abandoned due to failure to comply with biometrics requirements
(Jan. 16, 2018, IJ at unnumbered 1-2). See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.47(a)-(d). However, if that is the
case, then the Immigration Judge should include in his decision factual findings to show that the
procedural requirements for making such a finding were complied with. See Matter of D-M-C-P-,
26 I&N Dec. 644, 649 (BIA 2015).
The record will be returned to the Immigration Judge for preparation of a full decision
containing the necessary findings of facts and conclusions of law in adjudicating the respondent's
motion.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further action as required
above.
