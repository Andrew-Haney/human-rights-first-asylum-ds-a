IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: James G. Kim, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
July 21, 2017, decision denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant
to sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, 1231(b)(3),
and protection under the Convention Against Torture.' See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16-.18. The
respondent's appeal will be sustained in part and the record will be remanded for additional
consideration.
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of
credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including
questions of judgment, discretion, and law, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Immigration
Judge found both the respondent and his mother credible (IJ at 12).

The respondent's application for asylum, withholding of removal under the Act, and protection
under the Convention Against Torture is based on the harm he experienced in El Salvador
beginning in October 1986 when he was kidnapped and forced to join the El Salvadoran military
to fight against guerillas (IJ at 8-9). The respondent claims that following several months of
training he was sent to the mountains to engage in combat with guerillas and was “told to do bad
things” (IJ at 8). The respondent testified that he never fired his weapon and was constantly
seeking a way to get out of the military (IJ at 9). In 1987, the respondent's mother, with the
assistance of an acquaintance, was able to make arrangements for the respondent to be released
from military service if he was willing to submit to a beating (IJ at 9). The respondent submitted
to the beating, was released from military service, and was told that he should leave El Salvador
as soon as possible (IJ at 9). After making the necessary arrangements, the respondent departed
El Salvador, and arrived in the United States on or about August 26, 1990, where he has remained
ever since (IJ at 9; Exh. 2 at 1). The respondent contends that if he returns to El Salvador, he will
| The respondent has not challenged on appeal the Immigration Judge's denial of his application
for cancellation of removal under section 240A(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
8 U.S.C. § 12296(b)(1) (IJ at 2-3). We therefore consider this application waived. See Matter of
R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2011) (when a respondent fails to substantively appeal
an issue addressed in an Immigration Judge decision, that issue is waived before the Board); Maiter
of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. 191, 196-197 n.4 (BIA 1990) (noting that issues not addressed on appeal
are deemed waived).

be subjected to harm in relation to the conditions under which he left the military (IJ at 10). The
respondent also claims that he will be harmed by members of criminal gangs if he returns to El
Salvador (IJ at 10).
The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was ineligible for asylum because he
did not file his application for that relief within 1-year of arriving in the United States or establish
that an exception to that filing deadline applied (IJ at 4). The Immigration Judge concluded that
the respondent is ineligible for withholding of removal under both the Act and the Convention
Against Torture because he has been convicted of a particularly serious crime (IJ at 4-8). The
Immigration Judge also concluded that the respondent did not meet his burden of proof to establish
eligibility for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture because his fear of being
tortured in El Salvador is speculative (IJ at 10-13).
We affirm the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent is ineligible for asylum
because he did not file his application for that relief within 1 year of arriving in the United States
(IJ at 4). See sections 208(a)(2)(B), (D) of the Act. On appeal, the respondent has not specifically
challenged this aspect of the Immigration Judge's decision and we therefore consider the issue
waived. Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 658 n.2; Matter of Edwards, 20 I&N Dec. at 196-197
n.4.
We also affirm the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent did not establish
eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 9-13). The record
establishes that there is pervasive violence and crime in parts of El Salvador. However, it does not
establish that it is more likely than not that the respondent will be tortured by or at the instigation
of or with the consent or acquiescence (to include the concept of willful blindness) of a public
official or other person acting in an official capacity upon removal to El Salvador.
8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a)(1); Delgado-Ortiz v. Holder, 600 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir.
2010). On this record, we do not find a clear error of fact or error of law in the Immigration Judge's
determination that the respondent did not establish the requisite likelihood that he would be
subjected to torture with the consent or acquiescence of a public official upon his return to El
Salvador. We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent's fear of being tortured in
relation to his military service in the late 1980's is speculative. See Matter of J-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec.
912 (A.G. 2006) (holding that an alien's eligibility for deferral of removal under the Convention
Against Torture cannot be established by stringing together a series of suppositions to show that it
is more likely than not that torture will result where the evidence does not establish that each step
in the hypothetical chain of events is more likely than not to happen). The record does not indicate
that El Salvadoran authorities have any specific interest in harming the respondent.

2 While the Immigration Judge only considered whether the respondent established eligibility for
deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture in light of the determination that the
respondent has been convicted of a particularly serious crime, because the requirements to
establish eligibility for withholding of removal and deferral of removal under the Convention
Against Torture are otherwise identical, we consider both forms of relief here. See 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.16-.18.

However, we conclude that the Immigration Judge erred in holding that the respondent has
been convicted of a particularly serious crime such that he is ineligible to apply for withholding of
removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act. According to the Immigration Judge, the respondent
is ineligible for withholding of removal because he has been convicted of a “particularly serious
crime” within the meaning of section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act (IJ at 4-8). The factual basis for
that determination is the respondent's four convictions for driving while under the influence (DUI)
under California law in 1993, 1994, and twice in 2003, respectively (IJ at 5). The Immigration
Judge also appears to have considered the respondent's complete criminal history, including two
additional convictions of domestic violence under section 273.5(A) of the California Penal Code,
in 2004 and 2012, respectively, as well as several probation violations (IJ at 6-7). The respondent
challenges that determination on appeal, arguing that the offense does not rise to the level of a
“particularly serious crime.”
When an applicant for asylum and withholding of removal has been convicted of an offense
that is neither an aggravated felony nor a “particularly serious crime” based solely on its elements,
we assess the applicant's eligibility for protection by examining the nature of the conviction, the
type of sentence imposed, and the circumstances and underlying facts of the conviction.” Matter
of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336, 342 (BIA 2007); see also Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. 244,
247 (BIA 1982)).
We agree with the Immigration Judge that driving while intoxicated is an exceedingly
dangerous crime, and we in no way condone the respondent's actions. Accord Matter of
Siniauskas, 27 I&N Dec. 207 (BIA 2018). In our precedential decisions, however, we have
generally reserved the “particularly serious crime” designation for offenses of truly exceptional
gravity. See, e.g., Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 662 (BIA 2012) (possession of child
pornography); Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 343 (felony menacing involving the use or
threatened use of a deadly weapon); Matter of Y-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 274 (A.G. 2002) (drug
trafficking); Matter of S-V-,22 I&N Dec. 1306, 1308-09 (BIA 2000) (robbery), disagreed with on
other grounds by Zheng v. Ashcroft, 332 F.3d 1186, 1194-96 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of L-S-J-, 21
I&N Dec. 973,975 (BIA 1997) (robbery with a deadly weapon); Matter of B-, 20 I&N Dec. 427,
429-30 (BIA 1991) (aggravated battery with a firearm); Matter of Garcia-Garrocho, 19 I&N Dec.
423, 425-26 (BIA 1986) (burglary of a dwelling while armed with a deadly weapon or causing
injury to another); Matter of Carballe, 19 I&N Dec. 357, 360 (BIA 1986) (armed robbery with a
firearm)

Not all serious crimes can be “particularly serious.” See Alphonsus v. Holder, 705 F.3d 1031,
1048-49 (9th Cir. 2013), abrogated on other grounds by Guerrero v. Whitaker, 908 F.3d 541, 544
(9th Cir. 2018). Indeed, we have expressly held that, “except possibly in unusual
circumstances we would not find a single conviction for a misdemeanor offense to be a
'particularly serious crime.” Matter of Juarez, 19 I&N Dec. 664, 665 (BIA 1988) (finding no
particularly serious crime where the applicant was convicted in a municipal court for misdemeanor
assault with a deadly weapon). We have also concluded that even serious felonies such as
residential burglary and alien smuggling may not be particularly serious on their facts. See Matter
of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. at 247 (holding that burglary with intent to commit theft was not a
particularly serious crime where there (was) no indication that the (burglarized] dwelling was
occupied or that the applicant was armed; nor (was) there any indication of an aggravating

circumstance."); Matter of L-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 645, 655-56 (BIA 1999) (holding that alien
smuggling was not a particularly serious crime, even though the offense posed some risk to the
alien hidden in the floor of a van, because “there (was] no indication the (applicant] intended to
harm the smuggled alien” and the applicant “did not, in fact, cause her harm.”).
Moreover, the Immigration Judge did not rely on any aggravating element (in addition to the
DUI recidivism), such as injury to another person. Cf. Avendano-Hernandez v. Lynch, 800 F.3d
1072, 1078 (9th Cir. 2015) (affirming this Board's determination that a conviction under California
Health & Safety Code § 23153(b) for driving under the influence and causing bodily injury to
another person is a particularly serious crime); Anaya-Ortiz v. Holder, 594 F.3d 673, 679-80
(9th Cir. 2010) (same). The record does not reflect that any of the respondent's DUI convictions
involved any damage to property or injury to any person. Cf. Matter of G-G-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 339,
344 (BIA 2014) (noting that crimes against persons are more likely to be designated as particularly
serious), vacated on other grounds sub nom. Gomez-Sanchez v. Sessions, 892 F.3d 985 (9th Cir.
2018).
We therefore conclude that the respondent is not subject to the particularly serious crime bar
to withholding of removal. See section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act. In light of this determination,
we also conclude that remand is warranted for the Immigration Judge to make the findings of fact
and legal determinations regarding the respondent's eligibility for withholding of removal under
the Act in the first instance.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

ORDER: The appeal is sustained in part.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

FOR THE BOARD
Board Member Patricia A. Cole respectfully dissents from the majority's finding that the
respondent is not subject to the particularly serious crime bar to withholding of removal. The
majority's reliance on the absence of “exceptional gravity” or “damage to property or injury to any
person” ignores the Immigration Judge's particularized analysis of the nature and the
circumstances of the respondent's offenses as well as his sentence and punishments. The
Immigration Judge's analysis was consistent with Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336 (BIA 2007)
and Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1982); Mahini v. INS, 779 F.2d 1419, 1421 (9th
Cir. 1996). I agree with the Immigration Judge that the inherent dangerousness of the respondent's
repeated convictions for driving under the influence qualify as a particularly serious crime (see IJ
at 6-7); Alphonsus v. Holder, 705 F.3d 1031, 1042-43 (9th Cir. 2013) (“the key to determining
whether a crime is particularly serious is whether the nature of the crime shows that the alien poses
a danger to the community or the United States”). Therefore, I would dismiss the respondent's
appeal.
