In re: R
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Benjamin R. Winograd, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Jeffrey T. Bubier
Senior Attomey
APPLICATION: Termination; adjustment of status; waiver of inadmissibility; withholding of
removal
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals the Immigration Judge's May 17,
2017, decision terminating his asylum status under section 208(c)(2) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(c)(2), denying his application for adjustment of status in
conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility under sections 209(b) and 209(c) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
$$ 1159(b), 1159(c), and denying of his application for withholding of removal under section
241(b)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). The Department of Homeland Security
(“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded for
further proceedings.

We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a "clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de
novo. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On December 10, 2003, an Immigration Judge granted the respondent asylum as a derivative
beneficiary of his mother's asylum application under section 208(b)(2) of the Act (IJ at 1-2; Exh.
1; Exh. 2 at Tab D). The respondent did not thereafter adjust his status to lawful permanent resident
(Respondent's Br. at 1). On January 5, 2016, the respondent was convicted of flight to avoid
apprehension in violation of 18 PA. CONS. STAT. 8 5126(a) (hereinafter “g 5126(a)] and sentenced
to a term of imprisonment of 1 to 3 years (IJ at 2; Exh. 1; Exh. 2 at Tab B). Based on this
conviction, the DHS placed the respondent in removal proceedings and sought to terminate the
respondent's asylum status (IJ at 1-2; Exh. 1). With regard to terminating the respondent's asylum
status, the DHS argued that the respondent's criminal conviction constituted an aggravated felony
as defined in section 101(a)(43)(S) of the Act 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S) (an offense relating to
the obstruction of justice), and therefore a “particularly serious crime” under section
208(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act (IJ at 2; Exhs. 3-6). See sections 208(b)(2)(B)(i) and 208(c)(2)(B) of
the Act. The Immigration Judge agreed with the DHS, terminated the respondent's asylum status,
found the respondent removable, denied the respondent's applications for relief and protection
from removal, and ordered him removed to Guatemala (IJ at 2-3, 26; Tr. at 21-22).

On appeal the respondent argues that a remand is warranted “because Judge Golparvar never
issued a separate decision explaining his conclusion that flight to avoid apprehension under 18 Pa.
Cons. Stat. 5126(a) relates to obstruction of justice...” (Respondent Br. At 11). We agree that
remand is warranted in this case because the reasoning in support of the conclusion that 18 Pa.
Cons. Stat. 5126(a) is an aggravated felony is unclear, see Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA
1999), and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit's recent decision in Flores v. U.S. Att'y Gen.,
856 F. 3d 280 (3d Cir. 2017), undermines such a conclusion. We recognize that Flores was
decided after Immigration Judge Golparvar's decision on the aggravated felony issue. Clarifying
whether or not the respondent has been convicted of an aggravated felony is essential to resolving
the appeal.
The respondent also raises a number of other arguments on appeal relating to the procedural
posture of his case, his due process rights, the termination of his asylum status, and his eligibility
for relief from removal (Respondent's Br. at 11-31). We find it unnecessary to address these
arguinents, at this time. The Immigration Judge may reconsider any of these issues on remand or
any other issues raised by the parties.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained in part and the record is remanded to the
Immigration Court for further proceedings.
