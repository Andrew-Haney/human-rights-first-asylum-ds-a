IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Jesse Evans-Schroeder, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Jennifer Wiles
Senior Attorney
APPLICATION: Convention Against Torture
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appeals the Immigration Judge's decision of
October 4, 2017, granting the respondent, a native and citizen of Iraq, deferral of removal under
the Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.17. The appeal will be dismissed and the record
remanded for the completion of background checks.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a "clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge fully considered the record evidence, including the extensive
background materials, expert testimony, and the testimony of the respondent, his wife and his
cousin. The Immigration Judge concluded that if the respondent is returned to Iraq, he will be
immediately subjected to inspection by Iraqi security forces, where it is highly likely that he will
be identified as the spouse of a former U.S. Department of Defense interpreter (IJ at 22). The
Immigration Judge found that due to widespread fear among Iraqi security officers of U.S.
espionage, the respondent is very likely to be taken to a secondary detention center where he would
be subjected to harm constituting torture (IJ at 22-23). The Immigration Judge found that this
torture would occur at the hands of Iraqi security officers, sanctioned by the government (IJ at 23).
The Immigration Judge also found that relocation to avoid harm would not be feasible, as the
respondent would be detained immediately upon his arrival (IJ at 23). Thus, the Immigration
Judge concluded that the respondent met his burden of showing that it is more likely than not that
he will be tortured in Iraq by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public
official or other person acting in an official capacity. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).
On appeal, the DHS argues that the respondent, his wife, and his cousin were not credible
based on inconsistencies in the record. The Immigration Judge acknowledged some
inconsistencies in the testimony, but found the witnesses credible under the totality of the
circumstances. See section 240(c)(4)(c) of the act. We are not persuaded that the Immigration
Judge's credibility finding is clearly erroneous. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 341
(A.G. 2018) (the Board may only find clear error where the findings of fact “are illogical or
Cite as: A-H-A-B-, AXXX XXX 502 (BIA Aug. 31, 2018)
-502
implausible,” or without “support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record"
(citation omitted)). Furthermore, there is no dispute that the respondent’s wife was an interpreter
for the U.S. Department of Defense in Iraq, which is the basis for the respondent's fear of torture.
Thus, even if the inconsistencies present in the record were sufficient to establish an adverse
credibility determination, such finding would not, by itself, necessarily defeat a claim under the
Convention Against Torture. See Kamalihas v. INS, 251 F.3d 1279, 1282–83 (9th Cir. 2001).
Rather, in determining whether a respondent will more likely than not be tortured if returned to his
or her home country, “all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered.”
8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(3). The Immigration Judge relied not only on the respondent's testimony,
but that of the expert witnesses and the background country evidence presented.
Similarly, we review only for clear error the Immigration Judge's predictive findings of fact
regarding what is likely to befall the respondent on return to Iraq. See Matter of Z-2-0-, 26 I&N
Dec. 586, 590 (BIA 2015). Considering our standard of review, we are unable to find that the
Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including his predictive findings of fact, were clearly
erroneous. Clear error review precludes us from reversing the trier of fact even if we would have
decided the case differently had we been the factfinder. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North
Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985); Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003). On
the contrary, where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's
choice between them cannot be deemed clearly erroneous. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,
North Carolina, 470 U.S. at 574 (internal cites omitted); see also Maller of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at
341.

Contrary to the argument by the DHS on appeal, the Immigration Judge considered the
evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture, including the documentary and expert
testimony evidence of country conditions, and evidence of gross, flagrant, or mass violations of
human rights and other relevant information regarding conditions in Iraq. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(3);
Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 363-64 (9th Cir. 2017); Madrigal v. Holder, 716 F.3d
499, 510 (9th Cir. 2013). We cannot find persuasive the DHS’s argument that the respondent
failed to meet his burden of proof because his parents continued to live safely in Iraq for many
years, because there is no indication in the record that the respondent's parents were similarly
situated to the respondent. See, e.g., Kumar v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 1043, 1055 (9th Cir. 2006)
(reversing the Board's denial of asylum in part because the Board had considered the continued
safety of family members who were not similarly situated to the petitioner). Moreover, while DHS
raised some issues regarding whether some of the documentation evidence would support the
respondent being singled out for torture, the Immigration Judge found the expert testimony to be
persuasive in opining that the respondent would likely be tortured by government officials. DHS
did not present contrary evidence in this regard and has not shown that it was an impermissible
view of evidence for the Immigration Judge to find the respondent's experts persuasive. After
consideration of the record, appellate arguments, and the deference to be accorded to the
Immigration Judge's factual findings, the Immigration Judge's decision is based on a permissible
view of the evidence. Thus, we cannot reverse the Immigration Judge's ultimate determination
that the respondent established that he is more likely than not to be tortured by or at the instigation
of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official
capacity.
