IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL

CHARGE:
Notice:
Sec. 212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act 18 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)] -
Present without being admitted or paroled
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Iminigration Judge's decision
dated June 21, 2012. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's applications for asylum
and withholding of removal under sections 208(a) and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. S$ 1158(a) and 1231(b)(3), respectively, and her request for protection
under the Convention Against Torture. The respondent's appeal is sustained in part. The record
will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.'
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
The respondent contends that the Immigration Judge's decision should be reversed as she
credibly established past persecution on account of a protected ground. First, we agree with the
respondent that the Immigration Judge's decision that she is time-barred from asylum (i.e., due
to her untimely application and failure to present a valid justification thereto) was made without
first affording the respondent an opportunity to present testimony to explain the reasons for her
delay in seeking asylum (I.J. at 2; Tr. at 28-29, 120; Group Exh. 2; Respondent's Notice of
Appeal, Attachment at 1). As such, we find that the Immigration Judge should consider on
remand whether the respondent's untimely filed asylum application is excused under section
208(a)(2)(D) of the Act.
Next, as the issue of credibility has not been raised on appeal, we see no clear error in the
Immigration Judge's positive credibility fmding (I.J. at 8). See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.1(2)(3)(1)-(ii)
(the Board reviews an Immigration Judge's factual and credibility findings for clear error and
reviews de novo questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from
decisions of Immigration Judges). However, we conclude that the Immigration Judge erred, as a
matter of law, in holding that the respondent did not meet her burden for withholding of removal.

As recognized by the Immigration Judge, the respondent is a transgendered person but
preferred to be identified as a female (I.J. at 1-2; Tr. at 31; Respondent's Br. at 2).

On appeal, the respondent asserts that the Immigration Judge mischaracterized her proffered
social group, which consists of effeminate gay males with female gender identities (I.J. at 12;
Respondent's Br. at 4-9). We agree that the Immigration Judge provided an unclear analysis on
the issue of nexus given his conflicting findings and references to non-binding case law as to
whether the respondent demonstrated membership in a particular social group pursuant to the
above designation, as well as on account of being a homosexual (I.J. at 12, 14-15, 18).
Specifically, while the Immigration Judge held that the respondent's proffered group "would
possibly qualify for asylum,” he found that respondent was not included in this group because
she admitted that she would "change the way she lives" and hide her sexual orientation out of
fear if returned to Mexico (I.J. at 12-14). However, we find that the respondent established the
validity of the aforementioned social group, as well as her membership therein, and the fact that
she would hide her female identity or sexual orientation due to fear for her safety does not negate
the immutability of such characteristics (Respondent's Br. at 8-9).
Furthermore, it is well-established that sexual orientation can form the basis of a valid social
group under the Act (Tr. at 25). See Matter of Toboso-Alfonso, 20 I&N Dec. 819 (BIA 1994).
To the extent that the Immigration Judge held that the respondent's father—who was the main
source of harm for the respondent-- also abused other members of the family "for reasons
unassociated with their sexuality,” an applicant need not prove that a protected ground was the
only basis for the harm in question so long as a protected ground was or will be at least
one central reason for the claimed persecution (I.J. at 10; Respondent's Br. at 12). See Matter of
N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526 (BIA 2011); see also Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 208,
213-15 (BIA 2007) (citing section 208(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act).?

In addition, we find that the Immigration Judge erred in holding that the harm experienced by
the respondent did not rise to the level of persecution as contemplated by the Act. In this regard,
we see no clear error in the Immigration Judge's decision to not consider the respondent's sexual
assault from her father's coworker due to inconsistencies in the record (I.J. at 8, 10). However,
the Inmigration Judge appeared to credit the respondent's claim of suffering a homophobic
attack by an unknown assailant in public and, most significantly, the Immigration Judge accepted
her account of enduring near-daily abuse—as a child and adolescent—for many years at the
hands of her father (i.e., consisting of pistol whippings, lashings from a belt, beatings from a
machete handle and, on one occasion, a stabbing from a machete) for her effeminate behavior
(I.J. at 3-5, 8, 10; Tr. at 32-38, 52-56, 61, 65, 70-71; Group Exh. 2). The respondent also
suffered verbal abuse from her father in the form of homophobic slurs and threats of death due to
the respondent's sexuality and her father also directed his violence at the respondent's mother

For purposes of clarity, we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,
in whose jurisdiction this matter arose, has analyzed a factually similar claim for relief in an
wipublished decision. See Grijalva v. Gonzales, 212 Fed. Appx. 541, 543 (6th Cir. 2007)
(discussing the applicant's membership in a particular social group consisting of “obviously
effeminate homosexual men”). Similar to the respondent here, Grijalva “claim[ed) that he has
been very effeminate from the time he was a small boy and, as a result, has been abused for most
of his life.” See id. Although the Immigration Judge in that case "was convinced that Grijalva
[was] an effeminate homosexual and observed that homosexuality had been recognized as a
“particular social group”” by the Board, he found that Grijalva's claim of past persecution lacked
credibility. See id, at 545-46.

when she tried to protect the respondent (I.J. at 3; Tr. at 41-42; Respondent's Br. at 2, 8, 10).
On this record, we agree with the respondent that such cumulative harm amounts to persecution
(Respondent's Br. at 12-14). See Mece v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 562, 573 (6th Cir. 2005); Vincent
v. Holder, 632 F.3d 351, 356 (6th Cir. 2011) (an Immigration Judge should consider the
cumulative effect of the incidents of harm in assessing whether past persecution was established).
We also note that despite the Immigration Judge's suggestion to the contrary, there is no
requirement that applicants seek medical treatment for their claimed abuse (I.J. at 11). Further,
the Immigration Judge did not dispute the respondent’s testimony that she did not report her
mistreatment to the police out of fear that her father—a former policeman—would find out and
punish her and because her friend, did not receive police assistance after reporting
a homophobic beating (I.J. at 4; Tr. at 38; Respondent's Br. at 3).
Also, while recognizing the credible testimony provided by the respondent and her sister,
the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not present
adequate corroboration to support her claim of persecution. Specifically, the Immigration Judge
expressed concern due to the absence of testimony or a letter from the respondent's mother and
because the respondent's sister-- despite being deemed credible and corroborating the
respondent’s abuse from their father due to the respondent's sexual orientation—was unable to
verify the entirety of the respondent's abuse (I.J. at 5-6, 8-9, 11). However, while the respondent
argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred by not providing her notice of the need to
corroborate her claim in the form of supporting evidence from her mother, we need not address
this precise issue as we find that the respondent's sister adequately corroborated her claim.
In particular, the Immigration Judge fully credited the testimony provided by the respondent's
sister, particularly relating to the physical beatings (i.e., “with household objects and eventually a
machete") and death threats (i.e., with a pistol and a machete) the respondent suffered from her
father during childhood (I.J. at 5, 8-9; Tr. at 82-89). See section 208(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act; see
also Urbina-Mejia v. Holder, 597 F.3d 360 (6th Cir. 2010).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
Further, we find that the respondent has met her burden for withholding of removal under
section 241(b)(3) of the Act. Specifically, the Department of Homeland Security has not
rebutted the respondent’s presumption of future persecution by showing a fundamental change in
circumstances such that the respondent's life or freedom would not be threatened on account of
her sexual orientation or that she could avoid a future threat to her life or freedom by relocating
elsewhere in Mexico and that it would be reasonable, under all the circumstances, to expect her
to do so (Respondent’s Br. at 14, 17). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(i); see also Mece
v. Gonzales, supra, at 573. Additionally, as noted by the respondent, the Immigration Judge did
not acknowledge certain incidents noted in the 2011 State Department Human Rights Report
which were helpful to her claim (Exh. 3-GG) and did not consider the declaration submitted by
the respondent's expert witness, Dr. James Wilets, beyond Dr. Wilets's assessment of the State
Department Report (I.J. at 16; Exh. 3-EE; Respondent's Br. at 15-17). Also, the Immigration
Judge, while relying on the country reports in the record, observed that “violence against
homosexuals, mostly effeminate gay men, is described as “frequent” (I.J. at 15). The
Immigration Judge's fact-finding in this regard has not been shown to be clearly erroneous.
In sum, given the respondent's credible testimony and corroborating evidence, we find that
she established eligibility for withholding of removal. However, given that the Immigration
Judge did not sufficiently examine the basis for the respondent's untimely application (as noted
3
Cite as: M-G-O-, AXXX XXX 611 (BIA Feb. 4, 2014)
611
above), we conclude that he should provide the respondent an opportunity to present testimony
and other evidence on remand on the issue of her statutory eligibility for asylum. Upon remand,
if determining that the respondent has met her burden in demonstrating a valid exception to the
1-year filing requirement, the Immigration Judge should find that she qualifies for asylun as a
matter of law. See Matter of Patel, 16 I&N Dec. 600, 601 (BIA 1978) (recognizing the Board's
authority to qualify or limit a remand for a specific purpose). Accordingly, the following order
will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained, in part, and the respondent is determined, on
this record, to be eligible for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

FOR THE BOARD
Board Member Roger A. Pauley concurs in the order except for the portion
remanding for reconsideration of the Immigration Judge's finding that the
asylum application was time barred. While mentioned in the respondent's
Notice to Appeal, this issue was not pursued in the 18-page brief filed by
his counsel, which challenges only the denial of withholding of removal, and
CAT, and accordingly is waived. See Ramani v. Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 554 (6th
Cir. 2004); Hassan v. Gonzales, 403 F.3d 429, 433 n.5 (6th Cir. 2005).
