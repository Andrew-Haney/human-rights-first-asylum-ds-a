IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Imelda Maynard, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Ralph Girvin
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed the Immigration Judge's
January 8, 2019, decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and request
for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Sections 208(b)(1)(A), 241(b)(3)(A) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.13, 1208.16-1208.18. The Department of Homeland Security asks that the Board
summarily affirm the Immigration Judge's decision. The appeal will be sustained.

We review an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including the credibility determination,
under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues,
including issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent seeks relief as he is an openly gay man, and reports that he experienced past
ham on account of this fact at the hands of his father, classmates, and gang members. He fears
persecution and/or torture on account of his sexual orientation. The Immigration Judge found that
the respondent testified credibly. However, she denied the respondent's applications for relief as
she found that he did not demonstrate that he experienced past persecution, and/or met his burden
of demonstrating that the Honduran goverment was unable or unwilling to protect him, or would
acquiesce in his being tortured (IJ at 6-13).
To be eligible for asylum based on past persecution, “an applicant must show (1) an incident,
or incidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that is on account of one of the statutorily-
protected grounds; and (3) is committed by the govemment or forces the government is either
unable or unwilling to control.” Niang v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 1187, 1194-95 (10th Cir. 2005).
Alternatively, the respondent can qualify for asylum if he establishes a well-founded fear of future
persecution, which requires “both a genuine, subjective fear of persecution, and an objective basis
by credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record, of facts that would support a reasonable
fear of persecution.” Karki v. Holder, 715 F.3d 792, 801 (10th Cir. 2013). The term persecution
means not only persecution by the government, but also by private actors or groups that the

government is unwilling or unable to control. Batalova v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 1246, 1253 (10th

The respondent was beaten, sometimes with a belt, strangled, and abused as a young child by
his father because he played with dolls and the father did not want to have a gay son. As an
adolescent, he faced bullying and sexual assault by his classmates. More recently, gang members
targeted him for harm and threats. The Immigration Judge assessed each incident of ham
individually and concluded that none of the incidents amounted to persecution (IJ at 6-8). We
disagree and find that the harm the respondent suffered, starting as a very young child and
considered in the aggregate, rose to the level of persecution. See Matter of O-Z- & l-Z-, 22 I&N
Dec. 23 (BIA 1998). The Immigration Judge did find that the harm the respondent suffered was
on account of a protected ground, his sexual orientation. We agree.
The Immigration Judge also concluded that the respondent had not demonstrated that the
Honduran government was unable or unwilling to control individuals or groups that persecuted or
would seek to persecute or torture him. After his father beat him when he was a child, his mother
did not report it to the police because she took charge of everything in the family” (Tr. at 38).
However, as the respondent was 5 years old at the time, he could not have been expected to make
a report to the police. When the respondent was attacked in school, initially he was not believed,
but when his mother complained, his assailants were suspended from school for one week (Tr. at
42-43). When the respondent went to police to report the gang violence he encountered, the police
wamed him that if he made a report, he and his family could suffer repercussions by gang
members, so no report was made (Tr. at 56-58). The respondent also testified that the police were
afraid of the gangs and that they "work together” (Tr. at 57).

The 2017 Department of State report regarding human rights in Honduras cites societal
violence against LBGTI persons among the most significant human rights issues in Honduras
(Exh. 2E). It also notes accusations that elements of Honduran security forces harassed and abused
LGBTIQA persons. That report also states that the Honduran National Police have a Violent
Crimes Task Force which investigates crimes against particularly vulnerable victims, including
members of the LGBTIQA community (IJ at 8-10; Exh. 2E). Moreover, Honduran law states that
sexual orientation merits special protection from discrimination and includes it in a hate crimes
amendment to the penal code.
Although the Honduran goverment has made some efforts to address violence and
discrimination against LGBTIQA individuals, societal discrimination against and mistreatment of
that community remains widespread. Given the particular facts of this case, where past persecution
on account of sexual orientation has been found, we conclude that the respondent has adequately
shown that the government of Honduras has not been and is not able to protect him.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
