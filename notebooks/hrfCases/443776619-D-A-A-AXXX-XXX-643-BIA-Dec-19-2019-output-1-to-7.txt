IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Zoe P. Levine, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Scott D. Swanberg
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; remand;
reconsideration
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
June 28, 2019, decision denying his (1) applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture; and (2) motion to reconsider the denial of his
oral motion to admit supporting documents that were untimely filed. See sections 208 and
241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $8 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R.
$8 1208.13, 1208.16-1208.18. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the
appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent claims to have suffered past persecution and asserts that he has a well-founded
fear of future persecution based on (1) an actual political opinion and an imputed political opinion;
and (2) his membership in a number of particular social groups, which he defines as
(a) “Salvadoran children who are viewed as property"; (b) “Salvadorans who resist gang
recruitment"; (c) “Bisexual men"; (d) “LGBTQ persons in El Salvador": and (e)“Men imputed to
be gay in El Salvador" (IJ at 13-17; Tr. at 15-16). In support of his applications for relief, the
respondent submitted a number of supporting documents, including country condition reports and
statements from expert witnesses (IJ at 2; Exhs. 8-9, 13-14). The Immigration Judge excluded the
documents because they had been filed a day late and were, therefore, untimely (IJ at 2, 2 n.2, 8,
8 n. 16; Tr. at 14-15).
At his individual hearing, the respondent testified that, when he was very young, his uncle
would beat him any time he “made a mistake” (IJ at 3; Tr. at 32). He claimed that his father-
who had previously been in the United States—also beat the respondent whenever he refused to
address his father as “father" (IJ at 3; Tr. at 34). The respondent also claimed that his father would
abuse his mother, and that his father would shoot a pistol into the air whenever the respondent's
mother did not “do what he wanted” (IJ at 3; Tr. at 36).

-643
The respondent also claimed that he was mistreated by his cousin and his cousin's friends (IJ at
3; Tr. at 38-39). The respondent testified that his cousin joined MS-13 when they were both
children, and that his cousin continuously tried to force him to join the gang (IJ at 3; Tr. at 38, 41).
The respondent asserted that he would tell his cousin and his cousin's friends that “they were
wrong” for joining MS-13, but claimed that they continued to threaten and harass him into joining
the gang, despite his protests (IJ at 3; Tr. at 42-43). The respondent alleged that they called him a
snitch and attacked him on multiple occasions (IJ at 3; Tr. at 44, 48, 53). During one of the attacks,
the gang members attacked the respondent with a knife and cut him on his arm and back (IJ at 4;
Tr. at 46-47).
In addition, the respondent asserted that the gang members called him homophobic slurs
because they thought he was homosexual (IJ at 4; Tr. at 48-49). The respondent explained that he
identifies as bisexual, because he is attracted to men and women (IJ at 5; Tr. at 72). He claimed
that, before informing his attorney, he had never told anyone about his bisexuality because he was
worried that his family would reject him (IJ at 5; Tr. at 72-74). However, he testified that he had
sexual experiences with men on two occasions: once in El Salvador and once in the United States
(IJ at 5; Tr. at 74-80). The respondent claimed that he fears that he will be persecuted in
El Salvador because of his sexual orientation (IJ at 5; Tr. at 81).
!
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's applications for asylum, withholding of
removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 20). As relevant here,
although the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had testified credibly, he
concluded that the respondent had not provided sufficient corroboration for his claims (IJ at 6-9).'
The Immigration Judge also determined that the respondent was not eligible for asylum because
he made no showing that he qualified for an exception to the 1-year filing deadline (IJ at 9-12). In
addition, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent's motion to reconsider his oral motion to
admit untimely filed documents (IJ at 19-20).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Immigration Judge also determined that the respondent had not established his eligibility
for withholding of removal (IJ at 12). He found that four of the respondent's particular social
groups—“Salvadoran children who are viewed as property,” “Salvadorans who resist gang
violence,” “Bisexual men,” and “LGBTQ persons in El Salvador”—were not cognizable (IJ at
13-16). He also concluded that, although “Men imputed to be gay in El Salvador" constituted a
cognizable particular social group, the respondent had not established (1) a nexus between the
harm he previously suffered and that particular social group, and (2) that the government was
unable or unwilling to protect him (IJ at 16-17). The Immigration Judge also determined that the
respondent had not established that he was previously harmed on account of his actual political
opinion, or that a political opinion had been imputed upon him (IJ at 17-18). Finally, the
Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not established his eligibility for protection
under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 19). The respondent now appeals.
Because the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had testified credibly, the
respondent has a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal. See sections 208(b)(1)(B)(iii)
and 241(b)(3)(C) of the Act; see also section 240(c)(4)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(C).

First, contrary to the respondent's argument on appeal, we agree with the Immigration Judge
that the respondent did not establish that he expressed an anti-gang political opinion to his cousin
and the other MS-13 gang members, or that the gang members imputed an anti-gang political
opinion to him (IJ at 17-18; Respondent's Br. at 28-30). See Matter of E-A-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 591,
596 (BIA 2008) (holding that refusal to join gang, “without more, does not constitute a “political
opinion?"); Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 579,589 (BIA 2008) (rejecting the claim that resistance
to gang recruitment constitutes a political opinion because the applicants did not establish what
political opinion they held or provide evidence that the gang imputed or would impute an anti-
gang political opinion to them), both clarified by Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227
(BIA 2014), and Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014), aff d in part and vacated and
remanded in part on other grounds by Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied
sub nom. Reyes v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 736 (2018).
Moreover, even assuming the respondent established an actual or an imputed political opinion
against MS-13, we discern no clear error in the Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent
has not shown that his cousin and the MS-13 gang members were motivated to harm him on
account of an anti-gang political opinion (IJ at 17-18). See Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526, 532
(BIA 2011) (holding that the motive of a persecutor is a finding of fact to be determined by the
Immigration Judge and reviewed for clear error); see also Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1465
(2017) (holding that on clear error review, “[a] finding that is ‘plausible' in light of the full
record—even if another is equally or more so—must govern.“). As noted by the Immigration
Judge, the respondent testified that he was attacked by his cousin and cousin's friends because he
“refused to join” the gang, and that they called him a “snitch” on multiple occasions (IJ at 18).
The Immigration Judge determined that this evidence indicated that the gang members were
motivated to harm the respondent in order to increase the size and influence of their gang and to
control the behavior of others in order to continue their criminal enterprise ((J at 18). We discern
no clear error in these findings. See Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 532. We also note that the
respondent has not meaningfully challenged the Immigration Judge's motive finding on appeal
(Respondent's Br. at 28-30).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
With regard to the respondent's first particular social group, we agree with the Immigration
Judge's finding that “Salvadorans who resist gang violence” is not cognizable (IJ at 13-14). The
Board and the Attorney General have clarified the elements required to establish a cognizable
particular social group. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018); Matter of M-E-V-G-,
26 I&N Dec. at 237; see also Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208. An applicant for asylum or
withholding of removal based on his or her membership in a particular social group must establish
that the group (1) is composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic; (2) is
defined with particularity; and (3) is socially distinct within the society in question. See Matter of
M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec at 237; Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 212-18. To satisfy the
particularity requirement, a group must be discrete and have definable boundaries. See Matter of
W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 214. Here, contrary to the respondent's arguments on appeal, the
Immigration Judge correctly determined that “Salvadorans who resist gang violence” is not
defined with particularity because it does not have discrete and definable boundaries (IJ at 14). As
noted by the Immigration Judge, the proposed social group is "overbroad and defuse because it
encompasses a large subset of the general population, including those of any age, Salvadorans who
resist gang recruitment outside of El Salvador, and Salvadorans who resist recruitment from any

-643
gang” (IJ at 14 (emphasis omitted)). See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 335 (explaining that
“groups comprising persons who are ‘resistant to gang violence' and susceptible to violence from
gang members on that basis are too diffuse to be recognized as a particular social group."").
Turning to the respondent's second particular social group, we agree with the Immigration
Judge's determination that the respondent has not established that he was harmed, or will be
harmed, on account of his membership in the group “Salvadoran children who are viewed as
property” (IJ at 13). See Acharya v. Holder, 761 F.3d 289, 298 (2d Cir. 2014) (explaining that
applicant must demonstrate his or her “membership in a particular social group ... was or will be
at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.”). Specifically, we discern no clear error
in the Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent's attackers-specifically, his father, uncle,
cousin, and cousin's friends—were not motivated to harm him on account of his membership in
that group. See Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. at 1465; Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 532.
In support of his determination, the Immigration Judge first found that, in the future, the
respondent's attackers would not be motivated to harm him on account of his status as a
“Salvadoran child()” because the respondent is now an adult (IJ at 13; Tr. at 27). With regard to
past persecution, the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent had testified that his cousin and
cousin's friends were only 2 years older than he was (IJ at 14; Tr. at 40). Therefore, because the
respondent's cousin and his friends were of a similar age to the respondent, the respondent had not
established that they were motivated to harm him because of his age or because they viewed him
as property (IJ at 14; Tr. at 40). The Immigration Judge also found that the respondent's father
and uncle were not motivated to harm the respondent because of his status as a child, or because
they viewed him as property (IJ at 14). The Immigration Judge noted that he testified that his
father and uncle would beat him based on his actions – such as when he made a mistake" or
refused to call his father “father” (IJ at 14). In addition, the Immigration Judge found that, because
the respondent's father also abused the respondent's mother, who is an adult, the respondent's
father was not motivated to abuse the respondent specifically because he was a child (IJ at 14).
These findings are not clearly erroneous. See Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 532. In addition,
the respondent has not meaningfully challenged the Immigration Judge's motive finding on appeal
(Respondent's Br. at 28).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
On appeal, the respondent first asserts that the Immigration Judge erred by determining that
“Bisexual men” and “LGBTQ persons in El Salvador" are not cognizable social groups
(Respondent's Br. at 27-28). We agree. We have previously held that particular social groups
based on an applicant's sexual orientation are cognizable because they (1) are based on immutable
characteristics, (2) are defined with particularity, and (3) are socially distinct within the society in
question. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 237-39; Matter of Toboso-Alfonso, 20 I&N
Dec. 819, 822-23 (BIA 1990) (holding that homosexuals in Cuba were shown to be a particular
social group). On remand, the Immigration Judge should reassess whether the respondent is
eligible for his requested relief based on these cognizable particular social groups.
Turning to the respondent's remaining arguments on appeal, he asserts that the Immigration
Judge “[m]anifested [c]lear [b]ias” against his previous attorney and his previous attorney's
employer, Brooklyn Defender Services, which is an organization that provides legal services under
the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project (“NYIFUP”) (IJ at 8 n.16; Respondent’s Br. at
4
Cite as: D-A-A-, AXXX XXX 643 (BIA Dec. 19, 2019)
A
-643
:
14-15). Specifically, he asserts that the Immigration Judge's bias against NYIFUP caused him to
reject the respondent's supporting documents as untimely (Respondent's Br. at 14). The record
does not support the respondent's contention that the Immigration Judge was biased or otherwise
violated his duty to act as a neutral and impartial adjudicator. We note that the Immigration Judge
has broad discretion to set filing deadlines and may exclude evidence that is not in compliance
with those deadlines or the deadlines set in the Immigration Court Practice Manual. See Matter of
Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 265 (BIA 2010). Although the Immigration Judge noted that
he had previously informed NYIFUP attomeys that they needed to be aware of—and comply
with—filing deadlines, he acted within his discretion when excluding the documents from the
record and did not manifest any bias against the respondent's attomey by doing so (IJ at 8 n.16;
Respondent's Br. at 15; Tr. at 19).
The respondent also asserts that the Immigration Judge was biased against him based on his
sexual orientation (Respondent's Br. at 15-18). However, based on this record, we do not find that
the Immigration Judge was biased or that the proceedings lacked fundamental faimess. See Matter
of G-, 20 I&N Dec. 764, 780-81 (BIA 1993) (explaining that immigration “proceedings must
conform to the basic notions of fundamental faimess”); Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303 (BIA
1982) (explaining that, “[a]s a general rule, in order to warrant a finding that an [1]mmigration
[J]udge is disqualified from hearing a case it must be demonstrated that the [I]mmigration (JJudge
had a personal, rather than judicial, bias stemming from an “extrajudicial source which resulted
in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the [I]mmigration (J]udge leamed from
his participation in the case."). Rather than exhibiting bias, the record indicates that the
Immigration Judge misapplied existing case law when analyzing whether two of the respondent's
particular social groups were cognizable (IJ at 15-16). As noted above, we agree with the
respondent that remand is warranted based on that issue.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Upon remand, the parties may update the record with evidence—including testimony from
expert witnesses—regarding the respondent's eligibility for relief. After the record has been
updated, the Immigration Judge should specifically reassess (1) whether the respondent's credible
testimony has been sufficiently corroborated; (2) whether the respondent has adequately
demonstrated changed or extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely-filed
application for asylum from the 1-year filing deadline; (3) whether the respondent has established
his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal based on his three sexual orientation-based
particular social groups (including the questions whether the respondent has established a nexus

We acknowledge that, on appeal, the respondent challenges the Immigration Judge's exclusion
of his supporting documents by asserting that (1) his right to due process was violated when the
documents were excluded from the record, and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel
because the documents were submitted late (Respondent's Br. at 8-11). However, we need not
address these arguments because, in light of our ultimate holding in this case, the respondent may
submit the previously excluded evidence for full consideration by the Immigration Judge on
remand. We also need not consider the respondent's argument that the Immigration Judge erred
in denying his motion to reconsider the oral motion to admit the supporting documents because
that motion is moot since the record is being remanded for further fact finding and the respondent
can present his additional evidence (Respondent's Br. at 11-13).

to any of those groups, and has established that the Salvadoran government was or is unable or
unwilling to control the alleged persecutors); and (4) whether the respondent has established his
eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We express no opinion regarding
the ultimate outcome of the respondent's case.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
