In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Adam Jovanovic
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Remand
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
December 18, 2018, written decision, finding her ineligible for all relief. The record will be
remanded to the Immigration Judge.'
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues,
including questions of law and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for new proceedings, and for the entry
of a new decision which includes all necessary findings of fact. See Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec.
468, 473 (BIA 1999) (vesting the Immigration Judge with the responsibility for ensuring the
“substantive completeness of the decision'); see also Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 340-41
(A.G. 2018) (emphasizing the importance of Immigration Judges as fact-finders).
First, the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility finding is clearly erroneous. See Wang v.
Holder, 569 F.3d 531, 537 (5th Cir. 2009) (requiring that “an adverse credibility determination
still ‘must be supported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record.” (quoting Zhang
v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir. 2005)). The Immigration Judge found the respondent not
credible because her testimony was internally inconsistent and inconsistent with her credible fear
interview (IJ at 2). The main inconsistency specified by the Immigration Judge was that the
respondent testified she was a member of the Ewe religion, but she was previously listed as a
Christian (IJ at 2, citing Tr. at 14, Form I-213). However, the Immigration Judge did not question
the respondent about this perceived inconsistency, so we are unable to discem whether the
respondent converted at a later date, or if she perceives the Ewe religion to be part of Christianity,
or whether she was genuinely inconsistent. See Matter of B-Y-, 25 I&N Dec. 236, 242 (BIA 2010)
(requiring the Immigration Judge not to rely upon inconsistencies that take an alien by surprise).
| The respondent's request for a fee waiver is granted. Her request for oral argument is denied.

Second, the Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent's testimony was inconsistent with
her credible fear interview is not supported by the record (IJ at 2; compare Tr. at 14-23, with
Credible Fear Interview at 6).2 Third, the Immigration Judge did not make necessary findings
regarding the basis of the claim. See Mwembie v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 405, 413 (5th Cir. 2006)
(describing as “most troubling" an Immigration Judge's “lack of familiarity with the record”).
Apart from the credibility finding, the record does not reflect that the Immigration Judge issued
the necessary advisals to the respondent. The respondent was not informed of her right to apply
for asylum despite a positive finding that she had a credible fear of persecution, and her hand-
written statement alleging she had been raped and feared return to Ghana. The Immigration Judge
did not provide her with the Form 1-589, or instruct her on her right to counsel at no expense to
the govemment, nor provide her the opportunity to obtain such counsel if she so wished.
8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(c)(1)(i)-(iii); Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888, 889-91 (BIA 2012); see also
section 240(b)(4) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4); 8 C.F.R. &1003.16(b), 1240.3, 1240.10(a).
On remand, the Immigration Judge should provide the respondent with an asylum application
and carefully instruct her, on the record, of her rights. Id. The Immigration Judge should consider
all of the evidence, including the affidavit of the respondent's brother which she has submitted on
appeal. The Immigration Judge should then act as a neutral arbiter. See Wang v. Holder, 569 F.3d
at 540 (“[A] due process violation can be premised upon the absence of a neutral arbiter.”).
In sum, on remand, the Immigration Judge should: provide the application and advisals as
stated above. He should include in his decision clear and complete findings of fact that are
supported by the record and are in compliance with controlling law. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N
462 (BIA 2002).

Notably, the respondent maintained her best language is Twi, but her credible fear interview was
conducted in English (Compare Tr. at 3, 7, with Credible Fear Interview at 1).
