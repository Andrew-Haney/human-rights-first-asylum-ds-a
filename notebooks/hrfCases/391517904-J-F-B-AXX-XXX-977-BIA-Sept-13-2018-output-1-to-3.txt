IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Benjamin R. Winograd, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Billy J. Sapp
Senior Attorney
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated March 23, 2018, denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal,
and protection under the Convention Against Torture. See sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. 88 1208.16-.18. The
Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded.

We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of
credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including
questions of judgment, discretion, and law, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Immigration
Judge found the respondent credible (IJ at 12).
We will remand for the Immigration Judge to conduct additional fact-finding and analysis
regarding whether the respondent was convicted of a particularly serious crime and is thus barred
from asylum and withholding of removal. An alien is ineligible for asylum if he or she has been
convicted of a “particularly serious crime.” Section 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act; see also section
208(b)(2)(B)(i) (stating that a crime is deemed particularly serious if it is an aggravated felony).
For withholding purposes, a conviction constitutes a particularly serious crime if it is an aggravated
felony resulting in an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least 5 years” or if the Attorney
General determines that it is particularly serious, “notwithstanding the length of sentence
imposed.” Section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act.
Here, the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent’s 2011 conviction under
Maryland Code Annotated Criminal Law § 5-602 for possession with intent to distribute
marijuana was presumptively a particularly serious crime (IJ at 12-15; Exh. 2). See generally
Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002). We agree with the respondent's
argument on appeal that the presumption set forth in Malter of Y-L- only applies to aggravated
felony drug trafficking offenses (Respondent's Br. at 13-18). Id. at 274 (holding that “aggravated
felonies involving unlawful trafficking in controlled substances presumptively constitute
“particularly serious crimes' within the meaning of section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii).”). As both parties
agreed, and the Immigration Judge found, that the respondent's conviction is not for an aggravated
felony, we conclude a remand is necessary for the Immigration Judge to determine whether the

respondent was convicted of a particularly serious crime by applying the factors set forth in Matter
of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336 (BIA 2007), and Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1982),
in the first instance (IJ at 13-14 & n.2).
On remand, the Immigration Judge should also reassess the respondent's eligibility for relief
in light of the material and previously unavailable evidence that he submitted on appeal. See
8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); see also Malter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992). The new
evidence post-dates the Immigration Judge's decision and includes country conditions evidence
involving an uprising, and evidence that a family member of the respondent's has been threatened
in Nicaragua (Respondent's Br. at 8-10, 12, 23-24, Tabs A-H). We therefore conclude that the
respondent has established that remand to the Immigration Judge is warranted for consideration of
this new evidence.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing
decision and for the entry of a new decision.
