In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Christine Danielle McClellan, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Denise M. Bonk
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ghana, has appealed the Immigration Judge's
May 2, 2019, decision. The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's application for asylum,
withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to sections
208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, respectively, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158 and
1231(b)(3), and 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). The respondent contests the denial of all forms of relief.
The record will be remanded for further proceedings.

We review an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including findings with regard to
credibility and the likelihood of future events, to determine whether they are clearly erroneous.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, 677 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2012)
(holding that a determination of what will occur in the future and the degree of likelihood of the
occurrence is a finding of fact subject only to clear error review); Matter of Z-Z-O-,
26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review de novo all questions of law, discretion, and judgment
and any other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent claims that he is homosexual and was attacked about six times in Ghana due
to his sexual orientation. The respondent asserts that he is a member of a particular social group
consisting of men who are gay or are perceived to be gay in Ghana (IJ at 2). The respondent
contests the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility determination and her alternative finding that,
even if he had testified credibly, he did not adequately corroborate his claim.
The Immigration Judge found the respondent not credible because his testimony was lacking
in detail, internally inconsistent, and inconsistent with the record (IJ at 4). Based on the totality of
the circumstances, we conclude that the Immigration Judge clearly erred in finding the respondent
incredible regarding his claim that he is homosexual and was hamed in Ghana. See section
208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
The respondent has consistently asserted since entering the United States that he is homosexual
and was harmed because of his sexual orientation. See Exh. 1, Record of Swom Statement dated
June 11, 2018 (respondent stating in an swom statement taken before a border patrol agent a day

A

after his arrival in the United States that he was “constantly being beaten and harassed in Ghana
for being homosexual”); Exh. 1, credible fear interview notes dated August 27, 2018 (respondent
stating before an asylum officer in an interview conducted without the presence of counsel and
about 2 months after his entry into the United States that he is gay and was physically harmed in
Ghana because of his sexual orientation); Exh. 4, Tab A (respondent's affidavit signed
January 25, 2019, stating that he is gay and was physically attacked in Ghana by an anti-gay group
in his community on approximately six separate occasions because of his sexual orientation);
Exh. 3 at 5 (respondent's asylum application stating that a group of young men beat him about six
times because he is gay). The respondent also consistently stated in his credible fear interview,
asylum application, asylum statement, and testimony before the Immigration Judge that he was
physically harmed on six occasions because of his sexual orientation. See Exh. 1, credible fear
interview notes dated August 27, 2018, at 5; Exh. 3 at 5; Exh. 4, Tab A; Tr. at 53-54.
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not tell the asylum officer about a bar
fight incident and birthday incident, events which the respondent alleges occurred in 2009 and
2010 (IJ at 6). The respondent claims that he asserted in his credible fear interview that there were
six incidents and highlighted the incidents which were most important to him (Exh. 1, credible fear
interview notes; Respondent's Br. at 15). The respondent contends that he is not required to
mention every detail of his case in his credible fear interview and focused on the attacks that caused
him the most harm and that the target of the bar fight in 2009 was his ex-partner (Tr. at 54-56;
Respondent's Br. at 17-18). Inasmuch as the respondent told the asylum officer that there were
six incidents and discussed the most two recent incidents, the 2015 incident in which he was
harmed and the 2018 incident during which he was threatened, we conclude that the fact that the
respondent did not specifically describe the incidents in 2009 and 2010 in his credible fear
interview is not a sufficient basis for the adverse credibility determination (Exh. 1, credible fear
notes, at 5-7).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Similarly, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent did not adequately explain why he
did not tell the asylum officer that his former partner J went to France because a warrant was
issued for him due to the fact of his sexual orientation (IJ at 6). The respondent argues on appeal
that the asylum officer did not ask the respondent why J left Ghana (Respondent's Br. at 18).
Furthermore, the respondent contends that the person to whom the respondent was referring was
his friend
not his former partner,
(Respondent's Br. at 18). The
credible fear interview notes indicate that the respondent told the asylum officer than he had a
friend, named “J ,” who was subjected to similar treatment as the respondent and that he
had left Ghana. The respondent was asked where his friend was now and told the asylum officer
that the last time he spoke to his friend, his friend told him that he was in Libya on his way to
France (Exh. 1, credible fear interview notes at 6). The respondent was not asked further
information about this matter. We are not persuaded that this is a supportable basis for finding the
respondent incredible. See generally Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67, 78-79 (2d Cir. 2018) (“In the
immigration context, in assessing the probative value of the omission of certain facts, an IJ should
consider whether those facts are ones that a credible petitioner would reasonably have been
expected to disclose under the relevant circumstances”).
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent stated in his credible fear interview that he
“never had any problems with any of the men involved in the 2015 incident before” his 2015

beating (IJ at 5). The respondent testified that he was attacked by the same men in 2010 (IJ at 6;
Tr. at 89). The asylum interview provides that the respondent was asked if he ever had
any problems with these seven people before December 20th 2015” and the respondent replied
“No, I never had any problems with anybody, none of them” (Exh. 1, credible fear interview notes
at 7). The respondent was asked about this discrepancy at the hearing and testified, “What I was
telling him was that apart from the gay issue, I didn't have no problems whatsoever with them”
(Tr. at 89). The credible fear interview notes indicate that earlier in his fear interview, the
respondent told the asylum officer that he was harmed or threatened by a group of young men in
the area where he lived and when asked if the same people threatened and harmed him each time,
he responded, “Yes, the same group, because that group is in the same community as me” (Exh. 1,
credible fear interview notes, at 5).
The respondent claims that the Immigration Judge acknowledged but did not evaluate his
assertion that he had told the asylum officer that he did not have any problems with his assailants
"apart from the gay issue” (IJ at 11; Respondent’s Br. at 13, 16). The respondent claims that the
alleged discrepancy is not a sufficient ground for the adverse credibility determination because he
provided a reasonable explanation and the Immigration Judge did not evaluate it. See
Respondent's Br. at 16; Diallo v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 624, 629 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting Latifi
v. Gonzalez, 430 F.3d 103, 105 (2d Cir. 2005)) (an Immigration Judge should “engage or evaluate”
an asylum applicant's explanations for apparent discrepancies in the record). Considering the
entirety of the respondent's statements to the asylum officer, the cited discrepancy is not sufficient
to support the adverse credibility determination.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
>
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent testified incredibly, in part, due to the
respondent's characterization of his relationship with his former partner, I that they were
“living as a man and wife would” (IJ at 10; Tr. at 39). The Immigration Judge found that the
respondent's characterization that he lived with his partner "as man and wife would live” was
inconsistent with his statements in his asylum statement (IJ at 10-11). The respondent's statement
provides that they could not show affection in public because being gay is illegal in Ghana and
that most of the time they would go to hotels to have time together and sometimes
would go
to the respondent's house (Exh. 4, Tab A). The respondent argues that he should have been given
an opportunity to explain what he meant by the phrase "living as man and wife would” to determine
whether there was a meaningful discrepancy (Respondent's Br. at 19 n.1).
We conclude that this perceived discrepancy is not a sufficient basis for the adverse credibility
determination. The Immigration Judge and the counsel for the DHS raised this alleged discrepancy
at the conclusion of proceedings and the respondent's counsel explained that the respondent meant
that he and his former partner were in an intimate relationship (Tr. at 105-09). The respondent
was not asked about the meaning of this phrase at the hearing.
The transcript of proceedings supports the respondent's argument. Shortly after the respondent
testified that he and his partner “lived together as a man a wife would live,” the respondent testified
that they loved each other and were in a relationship for 3 years (Tr. at 39). The respondent also
subsequently testified that purchased him a car and would call him because we could not be
seen together, so we had a special spot” (Tr. at 39). The respondent also later testified that he did
not live with and never said that he lived with J (Tr. at 82). These statements are

consistent with the statements the respondent made in his asylum statement that they could not
show affection in public because being gay is illegal in Ghana and that most of the time they would
go to hotels to have time together and sometimes his former partner would go the respondent's
house (Exh. 4, Tab A).
The Immigration Judge found the respondent incredible, in part, based on the lack of detail in
his claim (IJ at 4). For example, the Immigration Judge observed that the respondent did not
provide a physical description of the men who attacked him (IJ at 7). However, the respondent
referred to his attackers as boys from the neighborhood and testified that he did not know their
names because he was not friends with them (IJ at 7; Tr. at 54). We conclude that the respondent's
testimony provided sufficient detail regarding his claim.
The respondent also submitted evidence to support his testimony regarding his claim. The
respondent submitted a sworn statement from Mr.
who previously had a relationship
with the respondent while there were both living in Ghana (Exh. 8). The Immigration Judge found
that the statement lacked specificity (IJ at 8). However, the statement provides, consistent with
the respondent's testimony, that Mr. and the respondent had a relationship for about
6 months in 2010 (Tr. at 42-43; Exh. 8 ). The statement also provides that they would spend time
at each other's houses and would sometimes go parties or the beach (Exh. 8 at 4). The statement
describes, consistent with the respondent's testimony, an incident in 2010 when Mr. and the
respondent were together celebrating Mr. l's birthday in the respondent's room in his
apartment when people entered the respondent's home and slapped the respondent while Mr. I
escaped (Tr. at 43-44; Exh. 8 at 4-5). We conclude that Mr. l's statement provides sufficient
specificity regarding his relationship with the respondent and the incident of harm which occurred
about 9 years ago and corroborates the respondent's claim.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The respondent also submitted a letter from his sister (Exh. 7). We agree with the Immigration
Judge that the respondent's sister's letter does not provide much detail. However, his sister's
statement provides, consistent with his testimony, that she is the only family member who knows
about his sexual orientation and that this was kept from the rest of her family. See Exh. 7; Tr. at
67 (testifying that only his sister knows he is gay).
Based on the foregoing, considering the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors,
we reverse the adverse credibility finding as clearly erroneous. See section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the
Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Furthermore, we reverse the Immigration Judge's determination
that the respondent did not adequately corroborate his claim. The respondent submitted statements
from his sister and a former partner to support his claim.' We are not persuaded by the
| The respondent reasonably explained that his sister and Mr. could not testify in person at
the hearing in Batavia, New York, because of logistic and financial hardship (Respondent's Br.
at 22). The respondent's motion for telephonic testimony provides that his sister lives in New
Jersey and is the caretaker for her husband, who suffers from a heart condition, and their 11-year
old child and Mr. lives in Maryland and was recently released from immigration detention.
We need not address the respondent's claims that he was denied due process when the Immigration

Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent could have obtained statements from a
friend named who is in Libya and a former partner named J who is in France (IJ at 10).
The record does not indicate that such evidence was reasonably available. Cf. section
208(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act. In particular, the respondent testified that he has not spoken to his
former partner since 2010 when his former partner told him not to contact him again (Tr. at 41-42,
98, 100; Respondent's Br. at 24). The respondent contends that he last spoke to his friend
when the respondent was in Brazil before he came to the United States and testified that
in Libya (Tr. at 98; Respondent’s Br. at 24).

Inasmuch as we conclude that the respondent testified credibly and adequately corroborated
his claim, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to make findings on whether the
respondent has established that he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of
persecution on account of his particular social group. Upon remand, the Immigration Judge shall
enter a new decision on the respondent's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

In re: S
CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINION: Deborah K. Goodwin
I write to dissent in part and concur in part with the majority decision. I respectfully disagree
with reversing the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility finding. The adverse credibility finding
is supported by inconsistencies within the record. The respondent has not fully explained these
many inconsistencies or his vague testimony, either at the hearing or in his appeal brief. “Clearly
erroneous" review precludes us from reversing an Immigration Judge's factual determinations
simply because we think we may have decided the case differently, or weighed the evidence
differently, had we been the fact-finder. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470
U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985). Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder's
choice between them cannot be deemed clearly erroneous. Id. Because I would uphold the adverse
credibility finding, I would not remand for further findings concerning whether the respondent
experienced past persecution. I would defer to the Immigration Judge's permissible view of the
evidence, and conclusion that the respondent had failed to establish past persecution. However, I
join the majority in reversing the Immigration Judge's findings concerning lack of corroboration.
The Immigration Judge accepted the witnesses' statements as credible. While the statements may
not adequately corroborate the incidents of past persecution, they do corroborate the respondent's
membership in a cognizable particular social group. I join in remanding this matter to the
Immigration Judge, but would have limited the scope of remand to consider whether the
respondent possesses a well-founded fear of future persecution, should he return to Ghana, based
on his corroborated membership in his particular social group, despite the adverse credibility
finding concerning his alleged incidents of past persecution.
