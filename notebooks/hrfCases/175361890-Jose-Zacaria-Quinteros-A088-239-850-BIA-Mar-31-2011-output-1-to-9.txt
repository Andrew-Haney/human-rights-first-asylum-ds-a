Notice: Sec.
212(a)(6)(A)(i), 1&N Act (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(AXi)] -
Present without being admitted or paroled
APPLICATION: Suppression, termination, voluntary departure
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
December 10, 2008, decision which incorporated a November 20, 2008, decision denying the
respondent's motion to suppress evidence and to terminate removal proceedings. We review the
Immigration Judge's factual findings for clear error and all other issues de novo. See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(DX(3). The case will be remanded.'
On April 25, 2007, the respondent's car was stopped by a Metro Nashville police officer and the
respondent was taken into custody and charged with driving without a license (I.J. at 1). On
April 26, 2007, the respondent was questioned by an officer who was cross-designated as a Davidson
County Sheriff Office-Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officer under section 287(e) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (I.J. at 1). This officer issued a Form 1-213 containing statements
made by the respondent (I.J. at 1). On April 27, 2007, the respondent was served with a Notice to
Appear and placed in removal proceedings (I.J. at 1). The respondent claims that at no point during
his detention was he advised of his rights under 8 C.F.R. & 287.3(c).

On December 10, 2008, the Immigration Judge issued a decision granting the respondent's request
for voluntary departure. All references to the Immigration Judge's decision herein refer to the
November 20, 2008, decision. See Exh. 7.
? Pursuant to section 287(8X1) of the Act, the Attomey General may enter into agreements by which
state officers who meet certain qualifications may perform "a function of an immigration officer in
relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States." See 8 U.S.C.
§ 1357(g)(1).

A088 239 850
Before the Immigration Judge, the respondent argued that his 1-213 should be suppressed
because, inter alia, the respondent's statements were obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment
exclusionary rule (I.J. at 2). The Immigration Judge found that there was insufficient evidence of
egregious conduct by the Davidson County Sheriff's officer (I.J. at 6). The Immigration Judge also
"passe(d) on finding whether the actions of the Metro Nashville Police officer who initially stopped
and questioned Respondent were in violation of the Fourth Amendment” because the officer's
actions were unrelated to the immigration proceedings (I.J. at 6).
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred by admitting the Form I-213
into evidence and denying the respondent's motion to terminate proceedings. According to the
respondent, his arrest and questioning violated 8 C.F.R. § 287.3(c) and the Fourth Amendment
search and seizure protections. See Respondent's Brief at 4-17. Further, the respondent argues that
he should have been granted an evidentiary hearing or discovery to prove that the evidence against
him was obtained illegally. See Respondent's Brief at 17-19.
The Immigration Judge found that there was conflicting evidence concerning the reason for the
initial traffic stop of the respondent in this case. The Metro Nashville officer indicated that he
stopped the respondent because an electronic database indicated that the respondent's car registration
bad expired (1.J. at 4 n.1). See Exh. 3, Tab 1. The respondent submitted photo and documentary
evidence, however, to show that his license plate and registration were not expired on the day of his
arrest (I.J. at 4).' The respondent alleges that he was stopped based solely on his race and therefore,
the I-213 and the respondent's statements therein should be suppressed due to the egregious nature
of the actions of the police. See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1050 (1984) (exclusionary
rule applies in removal proceedings only if the respondent can demonstrate egregious conduct);
Respondent's Brief at 11-12, 14-15.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
Despite the conflicting evidence, the Immigration Judge declined to assess the validity of the
traffic stop by the Metro Nashville police officer because the Immigration Judge found that this stop
was unrelated to the subsequent immigration questioning of the respondent (1.J. at 6). The
subsequent immigration questioning by the Davidson County Sheriff's officer, however, flowed
directly from the respondent's initial stop and arrest. Therefore, the validity of the traffic stop made
by the Metro Nashville Police must be assessed. Given the Board's limited fact-finding function,
it is "increasingly important for the Immigration Judge to make clear and complete findings of
fact that are supported by the record and in compliance with controlling law." See Matter of S-H-,
23 I&N Dec. 462, 465 (BLA 2002).
Therefore, we will remand this case to the Immigration Judge to make the necessary factual
findings in the first instance. See Matter of Exilus, 18 I&N Dec. 276, 278 (BIA 1982) (no due
process right to discovery in immigration proceedings.). Also, on remand, the Immigration Judge
should determine whether the agreement entered between the DHS and the Davidson County
Sheriff soffice allows for routine immigrationquestioning of all apprehended criminal suspectseven
without a felony conviction. See Respondent's Brief at 14.
3 The respondent also provided evidence that his criminal charge for driving without a license has
been reopened due to procedural violations (I.J. at 4).

A088 239 850
Finally, the respondent also argues that the statements contained in the 1-213 should be
suppressed because he was not informed of his rights under 8 C.F.R. & 287.3(c) upon his arrest. See
Respondent's Brief at 7. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held the
"obligation to notify the alien of his rights does not attach until the alien has been arrested and placed
in proceedings...." See Samazoa-Martinez v. Holder, 558 F.3d 897, 902 (9th Cir. 2009). Although
Samayoa is not controlling precedent in this case, we find it to be persuasive. See 8 C.F.R.
$ 287.3(c)("an alien arrested without warrant and placed in formal proceedings under section 238
or 240 of the Act will be advised of the reasons for his or her arrest and the right to be represented
at no expense to the Government') (emphasis added). For these reasons, we conclude that the
required advisals must only be provided after the respondent is given a Notice to Appear and placed
in removal proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion and the entry of a new decision.

DISSENTING OPINION: Roger A. Pauley
I respectfully dissent. The Immigration Judge found the police officer was enforcing the
criminal law and vehicle safety laws, i.e., car title and registration requirements as well as licensing
requirements, and did not stop Respondent for a perceived immigration violation.” IJ at 6 (Nov. 20,
2010). lo so finding, the Immigration Judge credited the Metro Nashville police reports, and there
is no contention, nor could there be, that this finding was clearly erroneous. It appears, if the
respondent's evidence is also credited, that the information in the police data bank was erroneous.
But that hardly makes the stop an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment, if a violation at all,
as it is well settled that a reasonable good faith belief in the legality of a search or seizure based on
a data base error will defeat an application of the exclusionary rule even in the criminal context. See
Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135 (2009), and cases cited.
I am thus at a loss to explain for what reason this case needs to be remanded for further fact
finding, and would affirm the ruling of the Immigration Judge.

ORAL DECISION AND ORDER OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
Respondent is an unmarried male, aged 28, native and citizen
of Honduras.
That respondent denied the charges in the notice to
Appear found at Exhibit 1, dated April 27, 2007.
Respondent
filed a motion to suppress at Exhibit 3, and the Government
responded at Exhibit 4.
Respondent also filed a motion to
suppress and an application to terminate and supplemented that
with Exhibit 6.
By order dated November 20, 2008, the Immigration Judge
denied the motion to suppress and the motion to terminate.
The
Immigration Judge also denied respondent's motion for discovery.
1
The order of November 20, 2008 is marked as Exhibit 7 and is
incorporated herein as though set forth at length.
The
Immigration Judge relies on Exhibit 7, his order of November 20,
2008, for the reasoning behind his decision to deny the motion to
terminate and the motion to suppress.
Respondent appears before the Immigration Judge today and
requests voluntary departure which the Department of Homeland
Security does not oppose.
The Immigration Judge will grant
voluntary departure according to the terms and conditions set
forth below.
Taken together, the Court enters this order:
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
ORDER
Respondent is granted voluntary departure up to and
including February 9, 2009.
Respondent shall post a bond of $500
with the Department of Homeland Security by December 17, 2008.
If respondent does not post the bond, this order of voluntary
departure automatically converts to an order of removal against
him to Honduras.
This will make respondent ineligible for
voluntary departure, adjustment of status, and cancellation of
removal for a period of ten years and also subject him to civil
penalties of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000.
The motion to terminate is denied;
