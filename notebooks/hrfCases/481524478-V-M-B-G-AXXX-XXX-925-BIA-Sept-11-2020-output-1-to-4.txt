IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Mark A. Stevens, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from the Immigration Judge's
April 2, 2018, decision denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant
to sections 208(a) and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(a),
1231(b)(3), and protection pursuant to the Convention Against Torture. The appeal will be
sustained in part and the record will be remanded for further proceedings.
We review the findings of fact, including determinations as to credibility and the likelihood of
future events, made by the Immigration Judge under a "clearly erroneous” standard. Matter
of Z-Z-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including issues of law, judgment or discretion,
under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The respondent testified that he became a member of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front (FMLN) in El Salvador in February 2011 and served as an “activist” for the party (IJ at 5;
Tr. at 18). The respondent testified that on February 14, 2014, gang members from the MS-13
gang tried to recruit him and coerce him into joining their gang (Tr. at 30-31, 36). The respondent
further testified that on February 15, 2014, while he and some friends were walking through a
soccer field after campaigning for the FMLN, supporters of the ARENA party, an opposing
political party, brandished guns at his group, issued a threat against one of his friends, and stated
that “they wanted their party to reign" and that the respondent's group “didn't have nothing to do”
in the area where they had been campaigning (Tr. at 19-22, 25). The respondent indicated on his
asylum application that he was seeking asylum based on his political opinion and membership in
a particular social group (Exh 2).'
We do not find legal error or clear factual error in the Immigration Judge's determination that
the respondent did not establish past persecution in El Salvador. The Immigration Judge properly
determined that the incidents of mistreatment described by the respondent did not rise to the level
1
The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent did not establish membership in a
cognizable particular social group under the Act (IJ at 6-7). The respondent indicated in his appeal
brief that he is not challenging this aspect of the Immigration Judge's decision (Respondent's Br.
at 4).

of persecution (IJ at 7; Tr. at 19-27, 31, 36). Notably, the respondent was not physically hurt
during the 2 encounters (Tr. at 20-22, 25, 30-31). On appeal, the respondent challenges the
Immigration Judge's finding that the encounter with the ARENA party supporters did not amount
to persecution. While a death threat may qualify as persecution, "[t]o constitute persecution,
actions must rise above the level of mere harassment, and must be of sufficient severity that they
constitute a threat to life or freedom itself.” See Cortez-Mendez v. Whitaker, 912 F.3d 205, 209
n.* (4th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We concur with the
Immigration Judge that a "mere threat” to the respondent that he should get out of the
neighborhood” is not a threat that constitutes past persecution (IJ at 7). The record supports the
conclusion that the respondent did not experience harm rising to the level of past persecution (IJ
at 7).
Notwithstanding, we find it necessary to remand the record for further proceedings and the
entry of a new decision relating to the respondent's claim of a well-founded fear of future
persecution in El Salvador. The Immigration Judge determined that “there (was) no evidence in
[the] record to show that” the respondent “was encountered by ARENA party members because
of his status as an FLMN party member” (IJ at 7-8). However, the respondent testified that during
his encounter with the ARENA party supporters, they told him and his friends that they wanted
their party to reign," and that they did not want the respondent and his friends in their neighborhood
(Tr. at 25). The respondent also testified that he believed that he and his friends were threatened
by the ARENA party supporters because they wanted his group to cease their activities supporting
the FLMN (Tr. at 25-26). The Immigration Judge did not find the respondent to lack credibility
relating to the February 15, 2014, incident (IJ at 6). However, when considering nexus the
Immigration Judge did not consider the respondent's testimony relating to his interaction with the
ARENA party supporters. See Alvarez Lagos v. Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 249 (4th Cir. 2019) (the Board
failed to consider all relevant record evidence when determining whether the alien failed to
establish the required nexus between her persecution and her proposed status as member of
particular social group).

In light of this, we find that a remand is appropriate in order for the Immigration Judge to
reevaluate the evidence of nexus presented in the respondent's testimony regarding his interaction
with the ARENA party supporters and its bearing, if any, on the respondent's claim of a well-
founded fear of future persecution in El Salvador on account of his political opinion. Further, on
remand the Immigration Judge should provide additional analysis and fact finding relating to the
respondent's claim pursuant to the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge's single
sentence relating to the respondent's failure to establish eligibility for protection under the Torture
Convention is not sufficient to allow us to meaningfully address the issues raised by the respondent
on appeal (IJ at 8). Since the Torture Convention does not require a nexus, the respondent's fear
of both ARENA party member and gangs need to be taken into account with respect to the
likelihood of future torture or the issue of government acquiescence. On remand, the parties may
submit additional evidence and argument concerning any relevant issue.
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
