IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL

ON BEHALF OF DHS: Nora E. Norman
Assistant Chief Counsel
CHARGE:
Notice: Sec.
212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. $ 1182(a)(O)(A)(i)] -
Present without being admitted or paroled
APPLICATION: Reopening
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered removed in absentia on
April 21, 2003. On December 22, 2014, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings that
was denied by the Immigration Judge on March 17, 2015. The respondent filed a timely appeal.
The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be
dismissed.
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility,
made by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues,
including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The record reflects that a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) was served on the respondent by regular
mail on December 23, 2002, to the address that he provided on his application for adjustment of
status based on his marriage to a United States citizen (Form I-485), dated February 27, 2001
(I.J. at 1; Exh. 1; Resp.’s Motion to Reopen at 3, Tab C). The respondent was subsequently sent
a notice of hearing by regular mail to that same address on January 15, 2003, informing the
respondent of an April 22, 2003, hearing date (I.J. at 1; Exh. 2). The respondent did not appear
for his hearing, and on April 22, 2003, an in absentia order of removal was entered and mailed to
the respondent via regular mail, again to the same address (I.J. at 1). On December 22, 2014, the
respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen in which the respondent alleged a lack of
receipt of both the NTA and his notice of hearing. The Immigration Judge denied the motion to
reopen, finding that both notices were properly sent to the respondent's last known address, and
that the respondent had not presented evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he had not received
them.

A078 567 541
The respondent argues on appeal that he did not receive the NTA or the notice of hearing
because it was sent to a “stale” address at which he no longer resided (Resp.’s Brief at 5). He
does not dispute that it was mailed to the address he provided on his Form 1-485. Rather, he
argues that he did not receive it there because it was actually his landlord's address and he
moved after he and his spouse separated, and he had provided a different address on a
Form G-325A, also dated February 27, 2001 (Respondent's Brief at 3-4, Tab B at 4,
Tab C at 11).
We find that this case is governed by our decision in Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181
(BIA 2001). In that case we held that entry of an in absentia order of removal is inappropriate
where the record reflects that the alien did not receive, or could not be charged with receiving,
the NTA that was served by mail at an address obtained from documents filed with the DHS
several years earlier. Furthermore, when an alien does not appear for a hearing, there remains an
uncertainty as to whether the alien received the address notification warnings set forth in the
NTA. Here, the respondent's NTA and notice of hearing were sent to an address that was
approximately 2 years old, and he has provided an affidavit that they were mailed to an address
in which he did not physically live and he did not receive them (Resp.’s Brief at 3-5, Tab B at 4,
Tab C at 11). We agree with the respondent that he did not receive adequate notice under
Matter of G-Y-R-, supra, because he did not receive, and cannot be charged with receiving the
NTA. Hence, the appeal will be sustained and the record remanded for further proceedings.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order of removal is rescinded, the
proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the
foregoing opinion.

DECISION AND ORDER OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
I.
Procedural History
The respondent is a native and citizen of Mexico who entered the United States without
being inspected, admitted, or paroled. Exh. 1. On March 1, 2001, the respondent applied for
adjustment of status based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. Respondent's Motion at 3. The
respondent provided his mailing address as 3201 Laura Koppe Road, Apt. 1, Houston, Texas
77093. Id. On March 28, 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sent a denial
notice to the address provided on the respondent's application. Id. On December 23, 2002,
DHS served the respondent, by regular mail to the same address, with a Notice to Appear (NTA),
charging him as removable from the U.S. pursuant to section 212(a)(O)(A)(i) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA or the Act). Exh. 1.
On January 15, 2003, the Court served respondent with a hearing notice ordering him to
appear before the Court on April 21, 2003. The respondent failed to appear as directed and the
Court ordered him removed in absentia to Mexico. See Order of the Immigration Judge (Apr.
21. 2003).
A 078-567-541
On December 22, 2014, the respondent filed the present motion to reopen. See
Respondent's Motion. DHS has filed an opposition to the respondent's motion to reopen
removal proceedings."
II.
Law and Analysis
A.
Statutory limitations on motions to reopen
A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days from “the date on which the final
administrative decision was rendered.” 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). Further, a party may file only
one motion to reopen proceedings. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.23(b)(1). There are three exceptions to these
time and numerical limitations: (1) motions to reopen to rescind orders of removal entered in
absentia; (2) motions to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions; and (3) motions
to reopen in which all of the parties agree to the motion and such motion is filed jointly. 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.23(b)(4); Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 163-64 (BIA 2013). Here, the respondent
seeks to reopen proceedings in order to rescind the in absentia removal order previously entered
against him.
B.
Rescission of in absentia removal orders
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded if: (1) a motion to reopen is filed within
180 days of the date of the order and the alien demonstrates that the absence was due to
exceptional circumstances; or (2) a motion to reopen is filed at any time and the alien
demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to a lack of proper notice in accordance with INA
$ 239 or that he or she was in state or federal custody at the time of the original hearing. See INA
$ 240(b)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The respondent contends that he never received notice of the removal proceedings against
him. Respondent's Motion at 3. DHS served the NTA by regular mail to an address which the
respondent previously provided on his application for adjustment of status. See Exh. 3. The
respondent claims that he moved away from that address and began living with his father around
February 2002, before the NTA and the notice of denial of his application for adjustment of
status were sent by DHS. Respondent's Motion, Tab B at 4.
The respondent essentially asserts that (1) he did not receive actual notice of the
proceedings against him because he moved, and (2) cannot be charged with receiving
constructive notice because he was not informed of the statutory obligations to update his
address with the Court, which take effect at the commencement of removal proceedings. The
respondent relies on Matter of G-Y-R, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001) in arguing that he cannot be
charged with receiving notice. In G-Y-R, DHS served, by certified mail, an NTA on an alien at
1
The court observes that DHS's opposition was not timely filed. As a result, the Court will not consider DHS's
brief in analyzing the respondent's motion.

A 078-567-541
an address that the alien had previously provided in an application for temporary protected
status. The certified mailings were returned as undeliverable, providing clear evidence that the
alien in that case did not receive actual notice of the proceedings. The Board further determined
that the alien could not be charged with receiving constructive notice for failing to update her
address because she was not yet under a statutory obligation to update her address.
The present motion is distinguishable from the circumstances in G-Y-R. In that case, DHS
delayed six years before sending out the NTA. Here, DHS sent the NTA to the respondent nine
months after his application for adjustment of status was denied. As a result, even if the
respondent had moved, his mail—including the notices—would likely have been forwarded had
he exercised reasonable diligence by either updating his address with DHS or making
arrangements with the postal service. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that the
NTA or the Notice of Hearing were returned to DHS or the Court.
In G-Y-R, the NTA and Notice of Hearing were sent by certified mail and returned as
undeliverable—providing concrete evidence that the alien in that case did not actually receive
the NTA. Here, the only evidence demonstrating that the respondent did not receive actual
notice of the proceedings against him are his own self-serving statements contained in an
affidavit attached to his motion. See Respondent's Motion, Tab B. The respondent has not
submitted any objective evidence that he actually moved away and thus did not receive the NTA
or Notice of Hearing. He did not submit affidavits from other parties with knowledge of relevant
facts (i.e. his former landlord, his father, his ex-wife); or other evidence that he moved such as
utility bills, pay-stubs, or tax records indicating his new address during the relevant time periods.

The Court need not address the issue of whether the respondent can be charged with
receiving constructive notice of the proceedings against him as he has failed to present sufficient,
credible evidence that he did not receive actual notice of the proceedings.
III.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds no basis for reopening the respondent's removal
proceedings. Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the respondent's motion to reopen is DENIED.
