IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
Violeta Delgado, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal
This matter was last before the Board on May 29, 2015, when we dismissed the lead
respondent's ' appeal from an Immigration Judge's decision denying her application for asylum
and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act, 8 U.S.C. &$ 1158, 1231(b)(3). 2 On July 3, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit remanded proceedings for the Board to consider in the first instance whether
“Guatemalan women” constitutes a particular social group.

To establish that a group defined as “Guatemalan women” is cognizable under the asylum and
withholding of removal statutes, the respondent must prove that the group is: “(1) composed of
members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and
(3) socially distinct within [Guatemalan] society .... .'" Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 319
(A.G. 2018) (quoting Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014)); see also Matter
of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208, 212-18 (BIA 2014), affd in pertinent part and vacated and
remanded in part on other grounds sub nom. by Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016),
cert. denied sub nom. Reyes v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 736 (2018).
We agree with the respondent's position on remand that being a woman is an immutable
characteristic (Respondent's Br. at 2, 4), as gender is fundamental to one's individual identity or
conscience. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 316, 318. However, we are unable to determine
The lead respondent's son is a derivative of her asylum application. Hereafter, references to
“the respondent” will refer to the lead respondent.
2 The respondent did not challenge on appeal the denial of her request for protection under the
Convention Against Torture and it is not implicated in the Ninth Circuit's remand.
3 The court agreed with our determination that “young Guatemalan females who have suffered
violence due to female gender" is not a particular social group.
The Department of Homeland Security did not submit a brief on remand.

1-911 et al.
from the record before us whether the social group of “Guatemalan women” satisfies the foregoing
“particularity” and “social distinction” requirements. As the requirements of particularity and
social distinction involve fact-finding that we cannot do in the first instance, remand to the
Immigration Judge is necessary. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of D-1-M-, 24 I&N Dec.
448, 451 (BIA 2008); see also Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 340-41 (emphasizing the importance
of Immigration Judges as fact-finders). In evaluating the particularity and social distinction of the
claimed group of “Guatemalan women,” the Immigration Judge should consider the Ninth
Circuit's decision in Perdomo v. Holder 611 F.3d 662, 669 (9th Cir. 2010), and its rejection of the
“notion that a persecuted group may simply represent too large a portion of a population to allow
its members to qualify for asylum ” See also Mohammed v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 785, 797 (9th Cir.
2005) (“[T]he recognition that girls or women of a particular clan or nationalityſ,] or even in some
circumstances females in general(,) may constitute a social group is simply a logical application
of our law.") (internal parentheses omitted); accord Ticas-Guillen v. Whitaker, 744 F. App'x 410
(9th Cir. Nov. 30, 2018).
Remand will allow the Immigration Judge to conduct additional fact-finding that may be
necessary for the required "evidence-based inquiry" as to whether the social group of “Guatemalan
women” meets the requirements of particularity and whether that group is perceived as “distinct”
in Guatemalan society. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 241-44; Matter of W-G-R-, 26
I&N Dec. at 221; Pirir-Boc v. Holder, 750 F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir. 2014). If the social group is
found to be cognizable under the Act, the Immigration Judge should consider whether the
respondent has demonstrated a nexus between the social group of “Guatemalan women” and the
past harm she suffered or future harm she fears. Additionally, per the Ninth Circuit's order, the
Immigration Judge should reevaluate whether the respondent's failure to report her abuse to the
Guatemalan police precludes her from showing that the Guatemalan govemment is unwilling or
unable to protect her. See Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051, 1069-70 (9th Cir. 2017)
(en banc); see also Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec.at 337-38 (an applicant seeking to establish
persecution based on violent conduct of a private actor must show the govemment condoned the
private actions or demonstrated an inability to protect the victims). We express no opinion
regarding the ultimate outcome of the respondent's case.
