In re: M94 a.k.a.[
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Robert F. Graziano, Esquire
APPLICATION: Termination; cancellation of removal under section 240A(a) of the Act;
asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Burma (Myanmar), appeals from the July 24, 2019,
decision of the Immigration Judge finding him removable, denying as abandoned his applications
for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents; asylum; withholding of removal; and
protection under the Convention Against Torture, and ordering him removed from the United
States. See sections 240A(a), 208(b)(1)(A), 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
8 U.S.C. $$ 12296(b), 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed any response to the appeal. The record will
be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.

We review the findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility
findings, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions
of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of
Immigration Judges de novo. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent was admitted to the United States as a refugcc on June 9, 2009, and adjusted
his status to lawful permanent resident as of that date (Tr. at 10; Exh. 1). The DHS issued an NTA
alleging, inter alia, that in 2018, the respondent pled guilty to attempted criminal possession of a
weapon in the second degree under N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(03); he was charged as removable
due to a conviction for a firearms offense under section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1227(a)(2)(C) (Exh. 1). The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged,
denied his applications for relief and protection as abandoned, and ordered him removed from the
United States. This appeal followed.
We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and to issue a new
decision. Initially, we point out that in her July 24, 2019, decision, the Immigration Judge stated
that at a hearing on May 1, 2019, the respondent conceded the allegations and charges in the Notice
to Appear (NTA). However, the respondent denied factual allegation number 5 in the NTA and
removability (Tr. at 10-11; Exh. 1). Moreover, the respondent filed a motion to terminate
specifically challenging his removability; the Immigration Judge summarily denied the motion on
April 30, 2019, but provided no specific reasoning except referring to the DHS's brief. She also
stated on the record that no findings of removability had been made (Tr. at 13). In her final
decision, the Immigration Judge did not provide any reasoning regarding removability, except to
state that “the respondent's removability has previously been established.” Under these

-181
circumstances, the Immigration Judge should reassess the contested issue of removability in light
of the specific arguments presented by both parties and provide reasoning to support her decision.
On appeal, the respondent also argues that the Immigration Judge erred in denying his
applications for relief and protection as abandoned because he did not file them by the June 25,
2019, deadline (IJ Order dated July 24, 2019; Tr, at 14; Respondent's Br. at 3-6). However, the
Immigration Judge did not provide any reasoning for her decision finding the applications
abandoned, which was issued before the final hearing scheduled for July 25, 2019. On appeal, the
respondent has filed an uncontested affidavit regarding the circumstances surrounding the filing
of the application. On remand, the Immigration Judge should reconsider the issue of abandonment
in light of the arguments presented by the respondent on appeal.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and
issuance of a new decision.
