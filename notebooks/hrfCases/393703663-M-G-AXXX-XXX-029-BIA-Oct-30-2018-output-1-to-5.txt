IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
Mohammed S. Omer, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Sandra Lindman
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal
The respondent, a native and citizen of Eritrea, has appealed from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated January 29, 2018, denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.
We will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for a new decision as discussed below.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent's application for protection under the
Convention Against Torture, finding that the respondent had shown that it is more likely than not
that he would be tortured upon return to Eritrea based on his desertion from the Eritrean armed
forces (IJ at 35). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not appealed from that
decision. However, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent's applications for asylum based
on the firm resettlement bar, and denied both asylum and withholding of removal because the
respondent did not show that the harm he fears is on account of a protected ground enumerated in
section 101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). The
respondent challenges these findings on appeal.'
I. FIRM RESETTLEMENT
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent's asylum claim is subject to the firm
resettlement bar, section 208(b)(2)(A)(vi) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi), finding that
the respondent had firmly resettled in Sudan or Israel (IJ at 7-20). As noted by the Immigration

The respondent challenges the Immigration Judge's concerns about his credibility
(Respondent's Br. at 8-10). However, as the Immigration Judge did not make an adverse
credibility finding, we will presume the respondent's credibility, and we need not address the
respondent’s arguments regarding credibility.

Judge, whether an asylum application is subject to the firm resettlement bar is determined under
the framework set forth in Matter of A-G-G-, 25 I&N Dec. 486 (BIA 2011). In that decision, the
Board noted that the framework for making firm resettlement determinations focuses exclusively
on the existence of an offer of permanent resettlement and allows for the consideration of direct
and indirect evidence. Id. at 501. The Board held that the DHS has the initial burden of securing
and producing direct evidence of governmental documents indicating an alien's ability to stay in
a country indefinitely. Id.
The Immigration Judge's decision does not address whether Sudan, Israel, or any other country
made an offer of permanent resettlement to the respondent. The Immigration Judge found that the
respondent's view that Sudan does not give asylum is contradicted by the information contained
in the “2010 Country Report,” presumably the Department of State's 2010 Sudan Country Report
on Human Rights Practices, which stated that the goverment of Sudan granted asylum to a large
number of asylum seekers (IJ at 17). However, the report, as quoted in the Immigration Judge's
decision, went on to state that Eritreans are required to register as asylum-seekers rather than being
granted refugee status, and furthermore refugees could not become resident aliens or citizens,
regardless of their length of stay, and they were not entitled to work permits (IJ at 17). Therefore,
to the extent the Immigration Judge found that the respondent could have stayed in Sudan
indefinitely, this finding is not supported by the report cited in the Immigration Judge's decision.?
As to whether the respondent could have stayed in Israel indefinitely, the respondent testified
that he had obtained a temporary status in Israel and applied for asylum, but his application was
denied and he was ordered to leave the country (IJ at 7-8). The Immigration Judge found that the
respondent did not obtain and submit a copy of the denial decision nor any other data maintained
by the Israeli govemment, thus he failed to corroborate his claims (IJ at 7, n. 4). However, as
noted above, the Board held in Matter of A-G-G- that the DHS has the initial burden of securing
and producing direct evidence of governmental documents indicating an alien's ability to stay in
a country indefinitely. In this case, the DHS did not secure and produce direct evidence of
government documents from Sudan or Israel indicating the respondent's ability to stay in those
countries indefinitely. Accordingly, while the Immigration Judge's decision refers to the four-step
analysis set forth in Matter of A-G-G-, the Immigration Judge did not apply the analysis.

The Immigration Judge relied extensively on extra-record evidence for his decision on firm
resettlement and other issues, taking administrative notice of a number of documents. The
regulation allows the Board to take administrative notice of commonly known facts or the contents
of official documents, although the Board is not allowed to make a factfinding in deciding an
appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). In comparison, Immigration Judges are authorized and
obligated to make necessary factual findings in the first instance based on the evidence submitted
by the parties. If and to the extent the Immigration Judge's factual findings are to be based on
administrative notice of extra-record evidence in any significant matters or to any significant
degree, due process would be best served if the parties are first given notice of such evidence and
an opportunity to address it.

Based on the above, the Immigration Judge's decision regarding fim resettlement is erroneous
as a matter of law, and is clearly erroneous as a matter of fact. We therefore conclude that the
respondent's asylum application is not subject to the firm resettlement bar.
II. NEXUS TO A PROTECTED GROUND
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s claimed grounds for hamm, i.e., desertion
from the Eritrean armed forces and unauthorized departure from that country, were not protected
grounds for asylum and withholding of removal, and they were not a basis for cognizable particular
social groups (IJ at 22-23). As to the respondent's political opinion claim, the Immigration Judge
found that the respondent was subjected to discipline or punishment while in Eritrean national
service because of his desertion, rather than because of a political opinion (IJ at 23). The
Immigration Judge also found that punishment for illegal departure from a country is not
persecution within the meaning of the Act (IJ at 34).
The respondent argues that punishment for violating departure laws may constitute persecution
for
purposes of asylum law if the punishment is severe, and he cites a number of cases to support
his argument (Respondent's Br. at 15-16). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
in a case that also involved an Eritrean who fled forced conscription, held that punishment for
violating conscription laws of general applicability does not in itself constitute persecution on
account of political opinion. Milat v. Holder, 755 F.3d 354, 361 (5th Cir. 2014). Rather, the Fifth
Circuit concluded that prosecution for avoiding military conscription may constitute “persecution”
only if the applicant shows either (1) the penalty imposed would be disproportionately severe on
account of a protected ground, or (2) the applicant would be required to engage in inhumane
conduct as part of military service. Milat v. Holder, 755 F.3d at 361; see also Matter of R-R-, 20
I&N Dec. 547 (BIA 1992); Matter of A-G-, 19 I&N Dec. 502, 506 (BIA 1987).

The respondent argues that he has demonstrated eligibility for asylum based on military
desertion under this standard (Respondent’s Br. at 17-18). The respondent does not argue that he
was required to engage in inhumane conduct as a result of military service required by the Eritrean
govemment. Rather, the respondent argues that the Eritrean goverment imposes
"disproportionate punishment,” because the punishment for desertion is disproportionately severe
for the offense (Respondent's Br. at 18-19). We need not reach this issue because we will remand
the record to the Immigration Judge because the Immigration Judge's decision did not adequately
address whether the respondent has suffered past persecution on account of a political opinion or
imputed political opinion. The respondent argues that, even accepting that his first two arrests

The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's asylum claim based on religion (IJ at 24-25),
but the respondent has not addressed this matter on appeal. The Immigration Judge also found
that the respondent's proposed particular social groups – (1) individuals who left Eritrea without
authorization, (2) individuals who deserted from national service, (3) Eritreans who did not pay a
tax while abroad, and (4) those who expressed opposition to the government when questioned by
Eritrean authorities while residing in other countries – are not cognizable under the Act (IJ at
22-23). The respondent has not contested the Immigration Judge's findings regarding lack of
nexus to a cognizable particular social group. We thus deem these issues waived. Matter of
R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 658 n.2.

were based on his leaving the military service without authorization, the third arrest occurred
because he spoke against the govemment in a meeting (Respondent's Br. at 14; Tr. at 47-49). The
respondent testified that he was arrested for the third time shortly after he spoke out at a meeting
against indefinite military service and hardship to his family (IJ at 6). The Immigration Judge's
decision does not show that the Immigration Judge considered the respondent's political opinion
or imputed political opinion claim based on his opposition to the goverment practice.
The motivation of the persecutor for asylum and withholding of removal purposes is a factual
question to be determined by the Immigration Judge. Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 453 (BIA
2011). Accordingly, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge to fully address these
claims. If the Immigration Judge finds that the third arrest and detention was on account of the
respondent's actual or imputed political opinion, the Immigration Judge shall also address whether
the harm suffered by the respondent from this incident rose to the level of persecution, such that
the respondent is entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution on the same
ground. See Matter of D-1-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448 (BIA 2008) (holding that the Immigration Judge
must make a specific finding that the applicant has or has not suffered past persecution based on a
statutorily enumerated ground). In light of our decision, we need not reach other issues. Based
on the above, the following order shall be issued.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with this decision, and for the issuance of a new decision.
