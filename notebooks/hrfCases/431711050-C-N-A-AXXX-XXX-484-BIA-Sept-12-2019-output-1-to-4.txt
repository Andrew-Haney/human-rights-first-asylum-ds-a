IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Ruby Lichte Powers, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Nora E. Norman
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cameroon, has appealed the Immigration Judge's
March 18, 2019, decision denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and
request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. Sections 208(b)(1)(A), 241(b)(3)(A)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.13, 1208.16-1208.18. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal, and
moves for summary affirmance of the Immigration Judge's decision. The appeal will be sustained.

We review an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including the credibility determination,
under the "clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues,
including issues involving questions of law, judgment and discretion, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent sought asylum based on her political opinion and her membership in a
particular social group composed of “Anglophone-speaking students in Cameroon who actively
protest the French-speaking indoctrination” (IJ at IV/D; Exh. 3). Specifically, she testified that
she supported the Southern Cameroons National Council's (SCNC) anti-Francophone efforts by
participating in a strike by English-speaking teachers, and refusing to attend school taught by
French-speaking teachers (Tr. at 25, 40, 47-53, 66-69, 83-84). She reported that she was arrested
on February 5, 2018, and April 25, 2018, was detained for 5 and 12 days, respectively, during
which time she was beaten.
The Immigration Judge found the respondent credible, and that the harm she experienced had
been at the hands of the Cameroon government' (IJ at III, IV/E). However, he denied asylum and
withholding of removal, finding that the respondent did not demonstrate that the harm she
experienced rose to the level of harm required for past persecution, that any harm she experienced
was on account of her political opinion or her membership in a particular social group, or that she
had a well-founded fear of future persecution. He also found that she did not demonstrate that she

more likely than not would be subjected to torture for purposes of protection under the Convention
Against Torture (IJ at IVIC, D, F; V). On appeal, the respondent has challenged these findings.
!
The Immigration Judge found that whether the respondent experienced past persecution was a
"somewhat close call” (IJ at IV/C). The circuit where this case arises has described persecution
as "[t]he ction of suffering or harm, under government sanction, upon persons who differ in a
way regarded as offensive (e.g., race, religion, political opinion, etc.), in a manner condemned by
civilized govemments.” Abdel-Masieh v. U.S. INS, 73 F.3d 579, 583-84 (5th Cir. 1996). “The
harm or suffering need not be physical, but may take other forms, such as the deliberate imposition
of severe economic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty, food, housing, employment or other
essentials of life.” Id. Persecution is an extreme concept that does not include all treatment our
society regards as offensive. See, e.g., Arif v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 677, 680 (5th Cir. 2007); Majd
v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir. 2006).
The respondent testified that she was imprisoned in overcrowded cells on two occasions for a
total of more than 2 weeks, during which time she was mistreated, punched and beaten up to three
times a day by guards using both belts and their hands to the point where she barely could sit down
and her body was swollen with rashes that continue bother her (Tr. at 49-53, 69; Exh. 3).
We initially note that the majority of the cases cited by the Immigration Judge in evaluating
whether the harm experienced by the respondent rose to the level of persecution were not issued
by the circuit where this case arises. See Malter of K-S-, 20 I&N Dec. 715 (BIA 1993) (the Board
is bound to apply the law of the circuit in cases arising in that circuit); Matter of Anselmo, 20 l&N
Dec. 25 (BIA 1989) (same). Moreover, the facts presented in this case are distinguishable from
the decisions cited by the Immigration Judge which were issued by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. See Eduard v. Ashcrofi, 379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir. 2004) (holding
that substantial evidence supported a finding that the harm did not rise to the level of past
persecution where the individual had experienced harassment, threats, and one episode of minor
violence); Abdel-Masieh v. U.S. INS, 73 F.3d at 583-84 (two arrests, two detentions, and beatings
not characterized as severe did not rise to level of past persecution). We agree with the respondent
that the mistreatment she experienced at the hands of the goverment was severe, constituted
“extreme conduct," and did rise to the level of harm constituting persecution.

Turning to the nexus issue, the respondent must demonstrate that the harm suffered was on
account of a protected ground. In evaluating nexus, the Immigration Judge found that her political
opinion claim “overlap(ped]” with her particular social group claim (IJ at IV/D). While the
Immigration Judge evaluated the respondent's particular social group claim, he neglected to
conduct a separate analysis of her political opinion claim. The Immigration Judge summarily
stated that she had not “satisfied her burden of showing past persecution on account of her political
opinion.” In so finding, he reasoned that the central motive for the harsh treatment of the student
protestors was on account of the disruption of the school day and their truancy, and that the
government had a right to stop students from protesting “when they were supposed to be in school”
(IJ at IV/D, emphasis in original). Under a “mixed motive” analysis, however, the finding that the
respondent was targeted for protesting while truant does not diminish the political nature of the
protest and her own strongly held political views.

The Immigration Judge's own underlying findings of fact, based on the respondent's credible
testimony and the objective background evidence of country conditions in Cameroon, indicate that
at least one central reason for the harm inflicted on the respondent was her engagement in a
political protest against a national govemment policy. Grossly disproportionate punishment in the
context of a protest against goverment policy in the ongoing political struggle in Cameroon
strongly indicates that political opinion or imputed political opinion was a central reason for the
harm inflicted on the respondent during her goverment detention. While controlling student
protests may have been a part of the reason for the govemment actions directed at the respondent,
the facts and context in which the student protests occurred in this case indicate that the
respondent's political opinion was also a central reason for her detention and her mistreatment
while detained. We therefore find that the respondent established that she suffered past persecution
on account of her political opinion.
Under the circumstances in this case, there is no indication of a fundamental change in country
conditions or other circumstances that would potentially rebut the presumption of a well-founded
fear of persecution based on the finding of past persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(A). Nor does
relocation within Cameroon appear to be a reasonable option. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(3)(ii).
Finally, the record does not indicate any basis for a discretionary denial of asylum. As we find
the respondent eligible for asylum, we do not address her claim for withholding of removal or
protection under the Convention Against Torture.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the respondent is found eligible for asylum.

FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
opportunity to complete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or
examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8
C.F.R. § 1003.47(h).
