Notice: Sec.
212(a)(6)(A)(i), I&N Act (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i)) -
Present without being admitted or paroled (all respondents)
APPLICATION: Termination
The respondents appeal from an Immigration Judge's April 3, 2009, decision denying their
separate motions to suppress the evidence of alienage offered against them and to terminate
proceedings. Because the respondents' cases were treated as a group below-i.e., they provided
testimony of record in one another's cases and have filed largely identical briefs raising identical
claims-we have consolidated these records for purposes of adjudicating the instant appeal. See
Ch. 4.10, Board of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual (“the Board may consolidate [ ] appeals
where the cases are sufficiently interrelated”); Tr. at 5, 199, 139, 143.' We have considered the
respondents' briefs in support of their appeals, the opposition of the Department of Homeland

· Security ("the DHS”), the respondents’ reply briefs to the DHS’s opposition, and the numerous and
lengthy exhibits offered in support of the appeals. We find that remand is required to clarify the
record and produce fact-finding on key issues that are central to this appeal.?
We review an Immigration Judge's factual determinations, including credibility determinations,
for clear error. See United States v. National Ass'n of Real Estate Boards, 339 U.S. 485,495 (1950)
(a factual finding is not “clearly erroneous” merely because there are two permissible views of the
evidence); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3). The Board reviews de novo questions of law, discretion,
judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges. Matter of A-S-B-,
24 I&N Dec. 493 (BIA 2008).
This appeal requires us to address the standards governing motions to suppress evidence
in removal proceedings. In INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51 (1984), the Supreme
Court held that, while the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is generally inapplicable to
deportation proceedings, this rule may be applied if there are egregious Fourth Amendment
violations that transgress Fifth Amendment notions of fundamental fairness, undermining
the probative value of the evidence. See also Matter of Sandoval, 17 I&N Dec. 70 (BIA 1979);
Matter of Garcia, 17 I&N Dec. 319, 321 (BIA 1980) (respondent made prima facie showing that
admissions were given involuntarily and the goverment presented no contrary evidence;
proceedings terminated); Matter of Toro, 17 I&N Dec. 340, 343 (BIA 1980). But we note that, in
view of the civil nature of deportation (and removal) proceedings, the “identity of an alien
(as distinguished from alienage) is not suppressible ... even if it is conceded that an illegal arrest,
search, or interrogation occurred.” Matter of Sandoval, supra, at 79.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
I. Background
Insofar as is relevant here, the background of this case is as follows. The respondent and several
other roommates were asleep in their apartment at 199 Atwater Street in New Haven, Connecticut,
2
Our consolidation of these cases for appeal is for purposes of producing an administrative decision
that is complete and accurate. Our decision to consolidate for purposes of appeal does not affect the
Immigration Judge's ability to sever these cases on remand if he finds that to do so is in the best
interests of justice.
3 The respondents make a host of contentions that, at bottom, are not relevant to the main question
presented here, i.e., whether the Forms 1-213-containing evidence related to the respondents'
alienage-should have been admitted into evidence in these removal proceedings. To the
extent necessary to address arguments raised on appeal, we will identify and discuss these
contentions in this order, but we note that although we have reviewed the many pages of
supporting documents filed by the respondents, we find much of the material (including
background evidence regarding a plan to provide identity cards to undocumented aliens in New
Haven, Connecticut) to be immaterial to the central question presented to us. We also note that to
the extent that the information was not presented below, and was not shown to be previously
unavailable or undiscoverable, it will not be considered by the Board in the context of this appeal.
See Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984).

in the early morning of June 6, 2007, when agents of the DHS’s Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (“ICE”) branch, along with officers from other law enforcement agencies, knocked and
rang the doorbell at the outside door to their apartment.* See Declarations of Respondents in Support
of Motions to Suppress Evidence (filed separately in each of the above-captioned respondents'
records of proceedings); see also pp. 5-6 infra. What happened in response to the officers knocking
at the door is in dispute regarding whether the officers entered 199 Atwater Street pursuant to the
consent of a resident. The DHS contends generally that a resident of the apartment gave the agents
consent to enter. The DHS also contends that its officers entered the apartment, encountered the
respondents and other residents, asked for identification, and detained the respondents for further
questions based on reasonable suspicion that the respondents were present in the United States
without permission.
Below, the respondents sought suppression of the Forms I-213 filed in each case, in which the
ICE concluded, in general, that the respondent who was the subject of each 1-213 did not have
permission to be present in the United States. On appeal, the respondents contend the Forms I-213
contain evidence gathered by means of an egregious illegal and non-consensual search and a seizure
based on race. See Respondents’ Briefs at 13-14; 17-55. The respondents also argue that the
proceedings below violated their Fifth Amendment rights to due process and fundamental
fairness, their first and Tenth Amendment rights, and the DHS's own regulations and policies.
Id. at 14, 55-64. Because we find that the record must be remanded for further proceedings before
we can exercise appellate review of the Fourth Amendment issues, we do not now address the
arguments raised by the respondents as to the First, Fifth, and Tenth Amendments or the
respondents' regulatory-based arguments.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
II. Legal Framework on Fourth Amendment Search Issue
As previously noted, the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment is generally not considered
applicable in removal proceedings. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra; Matter of Sandoval, supra. Even
if the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures was violated
during the operation at 199 Atwater Street, suppression of evidence that resulted from the
operation will only be necessary (if at all) when the constitutional violations are “egregious.”
INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, supra; Almedia-Amaral v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 231 (2d Cir. 2006);
Melnitsenko v. Mukasey, 517 F.3d 42, 46 (2d Cir. 2008). The guiding principle is whether the
consideration of the evidence trangresses Fifth Amendment notions of fundamental fairness.
Matter of Sandoval, supra. As the Second Circuit has recognized, evidence should be suppressed
4
As noted, the above-captioned respondents all appeared together at several hearings (see supra
note 2) with another roommate, Teresa Varo-Gonzalez, whose case was ultimately separated so that
she could pursue an asylum application (Tr. at 140). At this point, the Board is not aware of any
other aliens with pending appeals who were placed into proceedings as a result of the operation at
199 Atwater Street.

only when the record establishes that “an egregious violation that was fundamentally unfair
had occurred or that the violation undermined the reliability of the evidence in dispute.”
Almeida-Amaral, supra, at 235.
In the criminal context where, unlike in removal proceedings, the exclusionary rule of the
Fourth Amendment is fully applicable, a search conducted without a warrant issued upon
probable cause is “per se unreasonable.” Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973).
An exception to this general rule is when a person with authority has given voluntary consent
to the search. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, supra, at 223. That exception applies equally in
removal proceedings where we are required to assess whether a search violated the Fourth
Amendment and whether that violation was “egregious,” thereby justifying the exclusion of
evidence. Cf. Lopez-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir. 2008).
In removal proceedings, an alien seeking the exclusion of evidence based on the Fourth
Amendment bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case that evidence should be suppressed.
Matter of Tang, 13 I&N Dec. 691 (BIA 1971). The request to exclude evidence should be made via
a motion to suppress that is supported by an affidavit or other objective evidence that explains why
suppression is appropriate. Matter of Wong, 13 I&N Dec. 820, 822 (BIA 1971). The affidavit must
contain specific, detailed statements based on the personal knowledge of the affiant. Matter of Tang,
supra; Matter of Barcenas, 19 I&N Dec. 609 (BIA 1988). Only when an alien has come forward
with adequate evidence in support of suppression will the burden shift to the DHS to justify the
manner in which it obtained the evidence. Matter of Barcenas, supra, at 611.
Below, the respondents filed Motions to Suppress that argued that no consent was given at
the point of entry to the apartment. In support of the Motion, the respondents submitted sworn
affidavits in which each of the above-captioned respondents stated that he was told by a Ms. Sammy
Salazar, the person who is alleged (in one Form I-213) to have opened the exterior door to 199
Atwater Street, that she never gave consent to enter the apartment. The respondents also requested
that the Immigration Judge issue a subpoena to the ICE agents who first entered the apartment, for
the purpose of allowing testimony on the disputed point of consent. The Immigration Judge found
that the respondents had not met their threshold burden of submitting evidence that could point to
an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment (Tr. at 139). Because of this finding, the
Immigration Judge declined to subpoena testimony from any of the government agents involved in
the operation at 199 Atwater Street on June 6, 2007 (Tr. at 145). Specifically, the Immigration Judge
found that the search of 199 Atwater Street, although done without a warrant, was not shown to be
egregious because no direct evidence of non-consent was produced (I.J. at 27).

A. Facts Bearing on Consent
1. Form I-213
The Form I-213 filed in each case is at the center of the Fourth Amendment issues in these cases.
These documents detail, from the perspective of the ICE agents, what happened when the agents
arrived at 199 Atwater Street. What is at issue on appeal is whether the documents can be admitted
into evidence for purpose of showing the alienage of the above-captioned respondents, given the
arguments that Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights were violated by an egregious search and seizure

of the home. Because we are dealing with an early-morning entry into a private home, we are aware
of the unique and serious considerations at play in such an analysis, even in the context of a civil
removal proceeding. Cf. Lopez-Rodriguez v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir. 2008).
At the outset, we note that the four Forms I-213 filed in the four respondents' cases are
inconsistent with one another on the key issue of access and consent. That is, in only one of the
above ptioned respondents' cases (i.e., Luis Sedeno-1 A088 190 240) is Ms. Salazar
identified as giving consent to the ICE officers to enter. See Form I-213 filed May 8, 2008, in
Record of Proceedings (“ROP”) A088 190 240 (unmarked as an exhibit). In the case of Luis Sedeno
Trujillo's brother, Cirilo Sedeno-Trujillo (A088 190 241), the person alleged to have given consent
is Edelberto Sedeno. See Form I-213 filed May 8, 2008, in ROP A088 190 241 (unmarked as an
exhibit). There is no evidence in any of the four consolidated records of the above-captioned aliens
that Edelberto Sedeno lived at 199 Atwater Street or was present on June 6, 2007. See Tr. at 12. In
the Form I-213 filed in the case of Apolinar Flores-Romero (A088 190 244), nothing is said about
consent; rather the document only indicates that Flores was “encountered” during an ICE attempt
to locate a known fugitive, who goes by the A# 029 914 533. See Form I-213 filed May 8, 2008,
in ROP A088 190 244 (unmarked as an exhibit). Finally, the Form I-213 in the case of Amilcar
Soto-Velasques also says nothing about consent to enter, stating that he was “apprehended at
199 Atwater Street while a warrant of deportation at this address was executed.” See Form I-213
filed May 8, 2008, in ROP A088 190 229 (unmarked as an exhibit).
The inconsistencies among the I-213 documents alone strongly suggest that the record requires
further evidence on the issue of consent. Ms. Salazar, alleged to have given consent to enter, was
not present to testify. Each of the four captioned respondents filed an affidavit stating, in almost
identical language, that Ms. Salazar (alleged in one Form I-213 to have allowed the ICE officers into
the home) did not, in fact, consent to the officers' entry and search. See Respondents' Supplemental
Declarations, filed at Exh. B to Respondents' Reply to Government Brief Opposing the Suppression
of Evidence.?
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
2. Testimony and Affidavits
Each of the above-captioned respondents testified about what happened early in the morning on
June 6, 2007. Luis Sedeno-Trujillo (A088 190 240) testified that he was asleep in the same room
as his brother on June 6, 2007 (Tr. at 89). He stated that the door bell rang and there was knocking

The alleged “known ... fugitive” is identified by a different A number in Cirilo Sedeno-Trujillo's
file, i.e., 074 862 572. See Form I-213 filed May 8, 2008, in ROP A088 190 241 (unmarked as
an exhibit)

The Supplemental Declarations are written in English and have been signed by each respondent.
They include a certification of Regina Bateson that she is “fluent in both Spanish and English” and
that she “translated the above Declaration ... into Spanish.” It is unclear if that translation was
oral or in writing. The respondents each have indicated that they do not speak English. See
Respondents’ Declarations, filed at Exh. B to Motion to Suppress in each individual record of
proceedings.

on the back door of the apartment and that he was half awakened by these sounds. (Tr. at 90). There
are two doors to open to allow someone in the apartment (Tr. at 98). He heard steps in the apartment
and then someone entered his room (Tr. at 91-92). The person who entered told him to get up and
asked him for identification (Tr. at 92). The respondent understood the instructions (Tr. at 93-94).
He did not give the officers anything in response to their request and said nothing (Tr. at 94-95).
Luis Sedeno-Trujillo's brother Cirilo Sedeno-Trujillo (A088 190 241), testified consistently
with his brother that he was sleeping in his room when he heard the doorbell ring and that his cousin
Sammy Salazar opened the door (Tr. at 70-71). Two doors had to be opened before the ICE
officers could gain entry to the apartment (Tr. at 71). He was in bed when officers entered his room
(Tr. at 72). He was asked for identification, but he did not provide anything in response (Tr. at 73).
Amilcar Soto-Velasques (A088 190 229) was sleeping at 199 Atwater Street on the morning of
June 6, 2007, but did not live there (Tr. at 47). He was visiting his girlfriend Teresa Varo Gonzalez
(Tr. at 47). He awoke from the noise of the doorbell (Tr. at 50). He testified that two doors of the
apartment must be entered to gain entry to where the bedrooms are (Tr. at 50). He did not hear the
encounter at the door (Tr. at 51-52). The officers knocked on the door to his girlfriend's bedroom
and she opened the door (Tr. at 52-53). The officers directed him and his girlfriend to the living
room (Tr. at 54). Both he and his girlfriend provided identification in response to the officers'
request (Tr. at 55-56).
Apolinar Flores-Romero (A088 190 244) was sleeping in the living room at 199 Atwater Street
on the morning of June 6, 2007 (Tr. at 20). He awoke to the ringing of the doorbell (Tr. at 21).
Flores testified that Salazar went to the door and opened it but did not say anything (Tr. at 23).
Mr. Flores was equivocal on whether the agents and Ms. Salazar spoke after entering the apartment
(Tr. at 23, 43-44). He stated that the agents said nothing to anyone after entering (Tr. at 23), but later
asked him for identification (Id.). He first stated that the officers asked no questions except for
requesting identification, but later indicated that he did not remember whether they asked any
questions (Tr. at 25). He was advised that his affidavit indicated that the officers shouted at the
residents (Tr. at 27-28). He provided identification in response to the officers' request (Tr. at 24-25,
45).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
B. Remand for Additional Proceedings on the Issue of Consent
Given all of the above, the record is not clear as to what exactly occurred when the ICE
officers approached 199 Atwater Street. While we are mindful that the respondents bear the
burden of producing a prima facie case in support of suppression, we find that the inconsistency of
the core documents raises factual issues, the resolution of which requires further proceedings.
Matter of Barcenas, supra. The Immigration Judge's factual conclusion that Sammy Salazar gave
consent to the officers appears derived from (1) the lack of the respondents' direct knowledge about
the interaction at the door, and (2) the finding that Mr. Flores' testimony about the officers'
interaction with Ms. Salazar lacked credibility (I.J. at 25-26). But these findings raise questions,
such, e.g., as whether the alleged consent of Ms. Salazar was express or implied by her actions. The
Immigration Judge's conclusion, we find, does not reflect whether he gave full consideration to the
record, particularly the serious inconsistencies in the I-213s. While we find no clear error in the
adverse credibility determination, this proves simply that Mr. Flores had little credible evidence to
lend to the resolution of the question of consent. We note that there is other evidence of record that
6
Cite as: Luis Narciso Sedeno-Trujillo, A088 190 240 (BIA Sept. 22, 2010)
A088 1,90 240'et al.
would undermine the conclusion that Ms. Salazar gave consent to the officers, and other potential
avenues to secure additional evidence on this point.
We do not intend to convey here our acceptance of the various statements of the respondents
or to credit the alleged out of court statements of Ms. Salazar. We share the concerns of the
Immigration Judge about the respondents' lack of first-hand knowledge of Ms. Salazar's consent
or lack thereof, and note that although hearsay is generally admissible in immigration proceedings,
the weight it is accorded is subject to an assessment of its reliability. See I.J. at 25 (citing
Matter of Wadud, 19 I&N Dec. 182 (BIA 1984)). See also Felzcerek v. ÎNS, 75 F.3d 112, 115
(2d Cir. 1996). 8
But more generally, given the inconsistencies in the documentary record, there was an avenue
available to secure first-hand testimony about the encounter at the door between the officers and
Ms. Salazar, if she is, indeed, the person who answered the door. That avenue is production of the
testimony of the officers who approached the door, and then the Immigration Judge's on-the-record
assessment and weighing of this testimony. Were the Form I-213 documents that are of record in
each of these four cases consistent as to what occurred at 199 Atwater Street, we might share the
Immigration Judge's opinion that there is no need to gather additional evidence on the issue of
consent. But here, given the various inconsistencies on the issue of consent and the issue of why the
officers were at the apartment in the first place (since different “fugitives” have been used to justify
the search), we find that significant concerns have been raised about the encounter between agents
and the residents of 199 Atwater Street.
Furthermore, we find that the I-213s do not sufficiently reveal the exact nature of the evidence
used to support conclusions of alienage. That is, some respondents deny providing identification at
the home. Given this fact, the Form I-213 should reflect how the officers gained basic information
about each respondent in order to conclude that the person was an alien unlawfully present. Did the
key information come from the questioning during the initial search, i.e., in response to their
inquiries for identification (Tr. at 55-56, 73, 92)? Did the respondents each admit alienage, and if
so, at what point? If the respondents admitted only their identity at 199 Atwater Street, and alienage
was discovered through other investigatory techniques, the remedy of suppression may be
unavailable to the respondents. See Matter of Sandoval, supra, at 79 (“the ‘body' or identity of an
alien ... is not suppressible as the 'fruit of the poisonous tree” even if an illegal arrest or search
occurred). As we have stated, “[o]nce an alien's identity is learned, the (DHS) can entirely
avoid triggering the exclusionary rule ... where documents lawfully in the (DHS’s) possession
evidence unlawful presence.” Id.

Reliability of hearsay evidence is based on the sum of the circumstances surrounding the making
of the statement that render the declarant worthy of belief.” See Bierenbaum v. Graham, 607 F.3d 36,
50 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Nucci v. Proper, 95 N.Y.2d 597, 603 (2001)). In considering the
circumstances, a trier of fact takes into account, inter alia, the spontaneity of the statement, whether
it was repeated, the mental state and motive of the declarant, and the degree to which the statement
was against the interests of the declarant. Id. Moreover, other factors such as the specificity of the
information, the circumstances under which it was disclosed, and the degree to which it is
corroborated by other evidence, also can be relevant. Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 78-79
(2d Cir. 2004).

These open questions also contribute to our decision to remand this case for full consideration
of the various statements about consent, for supplementation of the record with testimony from one
or more of the various agents involved in the operation at 199 Atwater Street on June 6, 2007,
and for the Immigration Judge to assess what information was actually gathered at the apartment,
and whether suppression is an appropriate remedy in light of the answer to all of the above questions.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained. The record will be remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this order.
