IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Rose M. Thompson, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondents, 'natives and citizens of Honduras, appeal the Immigration Judge's
January 24, 2018, decision denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture. See sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3)(A)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has not filed any
response. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On appeal, the respondents argue that the Immigration Judge erred in denying their
applications for relief because they demonstrated past persecution and a well-founded fear of
persecution on account of their family-based particular social group (Respondents’ Br. at 6-7, 8-
11). The respondents argue that, because the Immigration Judge did not make an adverse
credibility finding, the respondents are presumed credible, and thus the Immigration Judge erred
by not giving them notice and an opportunity to bolster the lead respondent's credible testimony
with corroborating evidence (Respondents' Br. at 7). The respondents also argue that the
Immigration Judge erred in denying their motion to accept untimely-filed additional evidence
(Respondents’ Br. at 7-8). The respondents also claim that the Immigration Judge erred in denying
their applications for protection under the Convention Against Torture (Respondents’ Br. at 11-
12).
The respondents are a mother -738), the lead respondent, and her two minor children
), the co-respondents. They each filed their own applications
for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, and the
co-respondents are also derivative beneficiaries of the lead respondent's asylum application.

-738 et al.
The Immigration Judge's decision states that “the Court does not find that (the lead respondent]
has testified falsely in this case.” (IJ at 6). We therefore presume on appeal that the lead
respondent's testimony was credible in this case. See section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act
(stating that “if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made, the applicant or witness
shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.”).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises,
has held that an Immigration Judge must give an otherwise credible asylum applicant “notice of
the corroboration required” and “an opportunity to either provide that corroboration or explain
why he cannot do so.” Ren v. Holder, 648 F.3d 1079, 1091–92 (9th Cir. 2011). In this case, the
Immigration Judge found that the respondents did not present sufficient evidence to meet their
burden of demonstrating their eligibility for relief (IJ at 10-12). Specifically, the Immigration
Judge's decision states that the respondents did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate why
the lead respondent's father was killed, why they received threats after the killing, whether the
Honduran government was unable or unwilling to control those making the threats against them,
and whether interal relocation within Honduras was reasonable (IJ at 10-12).
Upon our review of the record as a whole, we are not convinced that the Immigration Judge
gave sufficient notice of the corroborating evidence required by the respondents in this case
consistent with Ninth Circuit precedent. See id. Thus, we will remand for the Immigration Judge
to give the respondents notice of the corroboration required in this case and “an opportunity to
either provide that corroboration or explain why (they) cannot do so. Id.; see also 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (limiting the Board's fact-finding authority and stating the Board may remand
the proceeding to the Immigration Judge where further fact-finding is needed); Matter of
Fedorenko, 19 I&N Dec. 57, 74 (BIA 1984) (noting that “[t]he Board is an appellate body whose
function is to review, not create, a record”).

On remand, both parties should have the opportunity to submit additional evidence and
arguments, and after assessing the record evidence the Immigration Judge should make a new
determination as to whether the respondents have established their eligibility for asylum,
withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. We express no
opinion on the outcome of proceedings on remand.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion
and for the entry of a new decision.
