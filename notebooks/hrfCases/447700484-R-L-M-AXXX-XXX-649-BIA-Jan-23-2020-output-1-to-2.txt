In re: R
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Patricia G. Gittelson, Esquire
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal
In a decision dated March 30, 2016, this Board dismissed the respondent's appeal from an
Immigration Judge's decision denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture, and ordering her removal to El Salvador. The
respondent thereafter filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. On May 24, 2019, the Ninth Circuit granted the petition for review in part and
remanded the record to this Board for further proceedings regarding the respondent's eligibility
for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), in light of Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 360 (9th Cir. 2017).'
The record will be remanded.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Barajas-Romero opinion was issued subsequent to this Board's March 30, 2016 decision.
It held that the proper standard for evaluating nexus in the withholding of removal context is that
a protected ground must be "a reason,” rather than “one central reason” for an alien's persecution.
Id. Thc Ninth Circuit determined that thc Immigration Judge and this Board erroneously applied
the "one central reason” nexus test in evaluating the respondent's withholding of removal claim,
rather than the less demanding “a reason" test. Id. Remand to the Immigration Judge is required
here because application of the "a reason” nexus test requires fact-finding, which is not this
Board's function. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526, 532
(BIA 2011) (holding that nexus is a finding of fact); Matter of D-I-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448, 451
(BIA 2008) (explaining that this Board has limited fact-finding ability).
Accordingly, the following order shall be issued.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further action consistent with
the foregoing opinion and for entry of a new decision.
