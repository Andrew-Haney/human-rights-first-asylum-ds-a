In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Timothy Patton, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Sarah M. Ellison
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
1
1
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
May 29, 2018, decision denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal under
sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. S$ 1158, 1231(b)(3),
as well as his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c).
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moves for summary affirmance. The record will
be remanded.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).”
The record reflects that the respondent, appearing pro se, filed his asylum application
(Form 1-589) and only checked the Torture Convention box (Exh. 2). However, the Immigration
Judge considered the respondent's applications for asylum and withholding of removal in addition
to his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3). The Immigration
Judge found the respondent credible, but denied his application for asylum finding that he did not
establish a nexus to a protected ground enumerated under the Act (Id.). Since the respondent was
pro se and did not indicate a protected ground on his asylum application, the Immigration Judge
construed his claim as “fear of gangs” (Id.). She then denied his application for asylum finding
that threats by gang members in their pursuit of a criminal purpose is not a protected ground for
purposes of asylum and cited Morales v. Sessions, 860 F.3d 812 (5th Cir. 2017), and its reference
to two other Fifth Circuit decisions addressing particular social group (PSG) based on the
perception of being wealthy (Enriquez v. Holder, 690 F.3d 667, 688 (5th 2012) and based on
political opinion (Thuri v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 788, 792-93 (5th Cir. 2004). The Immigration Judge
made no further findings on the respondent's application for asylum and cursorily denied
withholding of removal based on her denial of asylum (IJ at 3-4).

On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge never considered that he was a
member of a PSG related to his nuclear family. He argues that his membership was apparent from
his testimony, but more importantly, was found and indicated on his credible fear interview by the
DHS (Respondent's Br. at 1, 14). While we acknowledge that the respondent did not raise his
membership in a PSG before the Immigration Judge, we agree that there were indications in the
record the respondent's claim was based on his membership in his nuclear family as it relates to
his sons. In her decision, the Immigration Judge does not address the respondent’s PSG related to
his family nor does she make sufficient findings of fact regarding the alleged persecutor's
motivations and whether the respondent's PSG was one central reason for the persecution he
suffered or fears in El Salvador. See Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 40 (BIA 2017).
We conclude that a remand is appropriate for the Immigration Judge to further assess whether
the respondent has established membership in a PSG and the requisite nexus to a protected ground
for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. A remand will enable the Immigration Judge
to engage in any fact-finding that may be necessary to resolve the issues in this case. See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (discussing the Board's limited fact-finding authority); see also Matter of N-M-,
25 I&N Dec. 526, 532 (BIA 2011) (“A persecutor's actual motive is a matter of fact to be
determined by the Immigration Judge and reviewed by us for clear error."). On remand, both
parties should be afforded the opportunity to update the evidentiary record and present additional
legal arguments, and the Immigration Judge should reassess the respondent's eligibility for asylum,
withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT as appropriate.

Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
