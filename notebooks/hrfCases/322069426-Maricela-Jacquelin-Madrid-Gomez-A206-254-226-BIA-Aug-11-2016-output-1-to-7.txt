IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Rosana Kit Wai Cheung, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondent has appealed the Immigration Judge's decision dated December 16, 2014,
denying her motion to reopen. The respondent had previously been ordered removed in absentia

proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded.
The Board reviews an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including findings as to
credibility determinations and the likelihood of future events, under a “clearly erroneous"
standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-Z-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We
review all other issues, including questions of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo
standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

DECISION AND ORDERS OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
I. Procedural History
Maricela Jacquelin Madrid-Gomez (Respondent) is a native and citizen of El Salvador.
See Exh. 1. The Department of Homeland Security (Department) personally served Respondent
with a Notice to Appear (NTA) on November 24, 2013. The NTA alleged that Respondent was
not a citizen or national of the United States and entered the United States near Laredo, Texas on
or about November 22, 2013, and was not then admitted or paroled. Exh. 1. Accordingly, the
NTA charged her with inadmissibility pursuant to INA § 212(a)(6)(A)(i). Id. Jurisdiction vested
and removal proceedings commenced when the Department filed the NTA with the Court on
December 12, 2013. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a) (2013).
Upon release from custody, Respondent reported her address would be: 10826 South
Central Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90059. See Respondent's Motion to Reopen, Tab B.
Accordingly, the Department notified Respondent that she must report to the Department on the
thirtieth day of each month, and reminded her that she must not change residences without first
securing written permission. See id.
On March 26, 2014, the Court served Respondent with a Notice of Hearing (NOH),
sent via regular mail to her Los Angeles address, informing Respondent that her next hearing
was scheduled for April 16, 2014. The NOH was not returned to the Court as undeliverable. On
April 16, 2014, Respondent failed to appear for her hearing. The Court, proceeding in absentia,
1
found that removability had been established by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.
Accordingly, the Court ordered Respondent removed to El Salvador.
On October 14, 2014, Respondent filed the pending motion to reopen on the basis of
improper notice, alleging that she did not receive the NOH informing her of her April 16, 2014
hearing. For the following reasons, this Court will deny Respondent’s motion to reopen.
II. Law and Analysis
A. Motion to Reopen
1. Notice
The Court may rescind an in absentia removal order upon a motion to reopen if the
respondent demonstrates that she did not receive proper notice of the proceeding. INA
§ 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Written notice of a scheduled
proceeding must be given to the alien in person or, if personal service is not practical, sent by
mail to counsel of record or the respondent at the most recent address provided to the Attorney
General. See INA § 239(a)(1), (2); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 185 (BIA 2001).
Once the Department demonstrates that an NOH was sent by regular mail to an alien's
most recent address, there is a presumption of effective service. Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec.
665, 673 (BIA 2008). This is a weaker presumption than the Court applies to notice by certified
mail; however, an alien must present sufficient evidence that she did not receive the notice in
order to overcome this presumption. Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981, 987 (9th Cir. 2007);
Salta v. ÎNS, 314 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2002); M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 673.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
In determining whether a respondent has rebutted the lesser presumption of delivery, a
Court may consider: (1) the respondent's affidavit; (2) affidavits from family members or other
individuals who are knowledgeable about the facts relevant to whether notice was received; (3)
the respondent's actions upon learning of the in absentia order, and whether due diligence was
exercised in seeking to redress the situation; (4) any prior affirmative application for relief,
indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (5) any prior application for relief filed
with the Immigration Court or any prima facie evidence in the record or the respondent's motion
of statutory eligibility for relief, indicating that the respondent had an incentive to appear; (6) the
respondent's previous attendance at Immigration Court hearings, if applicable; and (7) any other
circumstances or evidence indicating possible nonreceipt of notice. M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at
674. “Each case must be evaluated based on its own particular circumstances and evidence,” and
the Court is “neither required to deny reopening if exactly such evidence is not provided nor
obliged to grant a motion, even if every type of evidence is submitted.” Id.
The Court finds that Respondent received legally sufficient notice of her scheduled
hearing. A respondent can be properly charged with receiving constructive notice, even if she
did not personally see the mailed document. G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. at 189. The Court mailed the
NOH on March 26, 2014 to Respondent’s most recent address on file: 10826 South Central
Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90059. Therefore, a presumption of delivery exists. See
Sembiring, 499 F.3d at 983; Salta, 314 F.3d at 1079.
2
Respondent has not submitted sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of
delivery. See Sembiring, 499 F.3d at 987-88; M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674. In support of her
claim, Respondent submitted a declaration in which she states that she never received the NOH.
See Respondent's Mot. to Reopen, Tab A. However, a declaration is only one factor this Court
considers. See M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674. Aside from this declaration, Respondent has not
presented evidence that indicates nonreceipt of the NOH due to mail delivery issues or any other
reason, and the Court notes that the NOH was not returned as undeliverable.
Although Respondent relies on Salta, 314 F.3d 1076, for the proposition that an affidavit,
alone, may suffice to rebut a presumption of delivery, that case is distinguishable. In Salta, the
respondent initiated removal proceedings herself so she could apply for relief. Id. at 1077.
Although she had attended an earlier hearing, she failed to appear at a removal hearing and was
ordered removed in absentia. Id. Under these circumstances, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
reasoned that an affidavit, alone, could rebut a presumption of delivery. Id. at 1079. In the
instant case, Respondent did not approach the Department and ask them to serve an NTA.
Rather, the Government caught and apprehended her as she was attempting to illegally cross the
border. See Respondent's Mot. to Reopen, Tab A. Additionally, Respondent has submitted an
unsworn declaration, which is not as persuasive as “a sworn affidavit.” Id. Because she did not
have as compelling an incentive to appear as the respondent had in Salta, her lone declaration is
insufficient to overcome the presumption of delivery.
In weighing both the positive and negative factors presented, the Court finds that
Respondent has failed to rebut the lesser presumption of delivery and has failed to demonstrate
that she did not receive proper notice of her April 16, 2014 hearing. As the Court finds that
Respondent received legally sufficient notice of her hearing, it declines to reopen her case on this
basis.

2. Sua Sponte
An immigration judge may upon her own motion at any time, or upon motion of the
Department or respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which she has made a decision. 8
C.F.R. $ 1003.23(b)(1). The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen is within the discretion
of the immigration judge. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.23(b)(1)(iv). The Board has stated that proceedings
should be reopened sua sponte only under “exceptional” circumstances and the Court's power to
reopen “is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the
regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976,
984 (BIA 1997). Moreover, the Board has indicated that where finality is a key objective, the
threshold for sua sponte reopening is extremely high. See Matter of 0-, 191&N Dec. 871 (BIA
1989).
A motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must establish
prima facie eligibility for the relief sought and must be accompanied by the appropriate
application and supporting documents. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94
(1988). A prima facie showing of eligibility includes demonstrating that the respondent is both
statutorily eligible and that the relief sought is warranted as a matter of discretion. INS v. Wang,
3
ང་，
ܪ
450 U.S. 139, 142-45 (1981). However, even if the respondent can demonstrate prima facie
eligibility, the Court may deny the motion to reopen in the exercise of discretion. INS v. Rios-
Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 449 (1985); Matter of Reyes, 18 I&N Dec. 249, 252 (BIA 1982).
Although Respondent has attached a Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for
Withholding of Removal, the application and declaration contain minimal information about
Respondent's potential claim. Specifically, Respondent has not provided any information in her
application or supporting documents about whether she was unable to leave her marriage, a
requirement to establish membership in her purported social group of Salvadoran women who
are in domestic violence relationships. See Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 388, 392-93 (BIA
2014). Furthermore, although she has submitted country condition reports, she failed to include
any information about whether she was persecuted by someone the government was unwilling or
unable to control. See id. at 395. While her attorney did allege in the motion that she meets
these criteria, Respondent's Mot. to Reopen at 10-13, the Court may not rely on the bare
statements of counsel as evidence. See INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 188 n.6 (1984) (stating
that counsel's unsupported assertions in a brief are not entitled to evidentiary weight).
Even assuming, arguendo, that Respondent provided enough information to make out a
potential claim for relief, the Court would nonetheless deny her motion as a matter of discretion.
See Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. at 449. Although the Court is sympathetic to Respondent's situation,
she failed to rebut the presumption of delivery, and therefore she had at least constructive notice
of the hearing she failed to attend. Thus, in the interest of finality, the Court declines to reopen
this case sua sponte. See O-, 19 I&N Dec. 871.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
B. Stay of Removal
Because this Court will deny Respondent's motion to reopen, it finds no basis on which
to grant her request for a stay of removal. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009) (stating
that a stay under the regulatory criteria is not a matter of right”).
Accordingly, the following orders shall be entered:
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent’s motion to reopen be DENIED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent's request for a stay of removal be
DENIED.
