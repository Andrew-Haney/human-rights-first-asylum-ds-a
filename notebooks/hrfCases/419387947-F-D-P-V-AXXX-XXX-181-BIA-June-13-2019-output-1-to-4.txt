In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Monika Sud-Devaraj, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of remo
moval; protection under the Convention Against
Torture
This matter was last before the Board on February 6, 2018, when we dismissed the respondent's
application for asylum and for withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158 1231(b)(3), and her request for protection
under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (Convention), 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16. On
September 21, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the
government's unopposed motion to remand. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.

The unopposed motion to remand requested that the Board further consider whether the failure
of counsel to timely file an asylum application for the respondent and prepare her for the merits
hearing amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, and if so, whether counsel's incompetence
was presumptively prejudicial under Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d 820 (9th Cir. 2011).
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility of testimony, under
the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462,
464-65 (BIA 2002). We review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, and judgment,
under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
As we noted in our prior decision, the respondent argued on appeal that her former attomey
rendered ineffective assistance in failing to file an asylum application within one-year of her arrival,
submit any corroborating documents, or prepare her for the merits hearing. The respondent also
provided documentation to meet the evidentiary requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988),' and she
also submitted relevant country conditions information conceming Guatemala.
"Ineffective assistance of counsel in a deportation proceeding is a denial of due process under
the Fifth Amendment if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented
1
The respondent presented her representation agreement with her former counsel, a letter to her
former counsel outlining her ineffective assistance claim, and her complaint to the State Bar
alleging deficient performance by her former counsel. She also submitted a response from the
State Bar to her complaint, which is mostly in Spanish, but does state in English that “further
investigation is not warranted at this time and our file has been closed."

from reasonably presenting his case.” Ortiz v. INS, 179 F3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir. 1999) (intemal
quotation marks omitted). "A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires a showing of
inadequate performance and prejudice.” Martinez-Hernandez v. Holder, 778 F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th
Cir. 2015). Moreover, where an attomey's incompetence prevents the alien from presenting her
case altogether, the proceedings are subject to a “presumption of prejudice," and the alien will be
found to have been denied due process if she can demonstrate “plausible grounds for relief" on her
underlying claim. Santiago-Rodriguez v. Holder, 657 F.3d at 835.
The respondent outlined in her appeal brief the deficiencies in her former counsel's
representation. Although the respondent retained her attomey in April 2013, a month after her
entry into the United States, the attomey did not file an asylum application on the respondent's
behalf until May 2, 2014, more than one year after her entry. At the hearing on November 12,
2014, the respondent's counsel indicated that he needed more time to prepare because he intended
to submit a substantial amount of corroborating documents from Guatemala (Tr. at 6). The case
was continued until March 2, 2017, for the merits hearing, and consideration of any argument that
the one-year filing deadline for asylum should be excused (Tr. at 7-8).
On February 28, 2017, two days before the merits hearing, counsel filed a motion to continue,
stating that the respondent was “still in the process of receiving documents and evidence from
Guatemala.” At the hearing on March 2, 2018, counsel apologized to the court, took responsibility
for the case not being ready, confirmed that no supporting documents had been submitted, admitted
that he had not done “everything ſhe was) supposed to do,” and indicated that the case “kind of
fell off the calendar” (Tr. at 13-15). Given that the merits hearing had been scheduled for more
than two years, the Immigration Judge denied the motion to continue (Tr. at 15-17).

We conclude that the lent established ineffective assistance by her former counsel. The
respondent's attomey did not timely file an application for asylum, which precluded all
consideration of this form of relief from removal. Although counsel indicated that significant
documentation from Guatemala would be presented, no supporting documentation was submitted.
In her complaint to the State Bar, the respondent stated that her former attomey did not ask for
documentation until three days before the merits hearing. Counsel admitted to the court that he
was at fault in failing to properly prepare the case for presentation at the merits hearing.
i
:
We also conclude that the respondent presented plausible grounds for relief to support a remand.
While the Immigration Judge denied withholding of removal, as noted above, no supporting
documentation was presented, and only a “barebones” application was submitted (Tr. at 8). The
respondent also asserted that her attomey did not prepare her for the hearing. Moreover, the
standards for asylum and withholding of removal are different. The respondent alleges that she
was threatened in Guatemala and that a close family member was killed based on a protected
ground enumerated in the Act. We conclude that the respondent should be afforded an opportunity
present her claim for asylum with proper documentation and preparation.
