IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Sigang LI, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Georgette Pinillos
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Venezuela, appeals the Immigration Judge's April 19,
2018, decision denying his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
8 C.F.R. S$ 1208.13, 1208.16-1208.18.' The record will be remanded.
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous" standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has articulated a two-part test in Myrie
v. Att 'y Gen of U.S., 855 F.3d 509, 516 (3d Cir. 2017), for claims for protection under the
Convention Against Torture—first, an Immigration Judge must determine “whether an applicant
has met the burden of establishing that it is more likely than not (the respondent) would be tortured
ifremoved," and then the Immigration Judge must consider whether public officials will acquiesce
in the likely treatment. See Quinteros v. Att'y Gen of the U.S., 945 F.3d 772, 786 (3d Cir. 2019).
In regard to the first prong, the Immigration Judge should assess “(1) what is likely to happen to
the petitioner if removed; and (2) does what is likely to happen amount to the legal definition of
torture.” Id. (citing Kaplun v. Att 'y Gen. of U.S., 602 F.3d 260, 271 (3d Cir. 2010)). The two parts
are to be examined separately; the first question is factual and the second is a legal question.
Kaplun v. Att'y Gen. of U.S., 602 F.3d at 271. In regard to govemment acquiescence, Myrie
requires an analysis of “how public officials will likely act in response to the harm the petitioner
fears” and “whether the likely response from public officials qualifies as acquiescence.” Myrie
v. Att'y Gen of U.S., 855 F.3d at 516.
Although the Immigration Judge's decision denies the respondent's supposed request for asylum
and withholding of removal relief, the respondent indicated on the record that he intended to solely
apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture, and has limited his appeal accordingly
(Tr. at 61, 88, 120; Exh. 3).

-717.
Here, the Immigration Judge has not provided the analysis as required by Myrie (IJ at 13-14).
The Immigration Judge stated that the respondent no longer faces a likelihood of harm in
Venezuela because Hugo Chavez is no longer in power (IJ at 13-14). However, the Immigration
Judge did not consider the respondent's written statement that he fears torture in Venezuela
because he believes the current administration, which was put into power after Hugo Chavez
passed away, would view him as a spy due to the length of time that he resided in the United States
(Exh. 7 at 1-3; Tr. at 118-120). Further, the respondent testified that his friend, who also lived in
the United States for an extended amount of time, was interrogated by Venezuelan police and then
went missing (IJ at 5-7). When the respondent inquired after his friend's disappearance with the
Venezuelan police, the respondent's family was threatened (IJ at 6-7). Country conditions reports
also describe a state of violence in the country, frequently coupled with torture, promulgated by
the current president of Venezuela toward anyone viewed as opposition, including American
citizens (Exh. 4 at 1-4, 8, 14-15).
The Immigration Judge did not make any factual findings or legal analysis regarding the
likelihood the respondent would face torture in light of the foregoing testimony and evidence, nor
did the Immigration Judge determine whether the Venezuelan government would partake in, or
acquiesce to, harm the respondent states he may face. As such, we remand the record to provide
the Immigration Judge with the opportunity to determine whether the respondent has established
eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N
Dec. 462 (BIA 2002).
The parties should be allowed to provide further evidence, including country conditions reports
and additional testimony. We express no opinion as to the outcome of these proceedings.

ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
