In re: W
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Eman H. Jajonie-Daman, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
This matter was most recently before us on April 5, 2018, when we denied the respondent's
motion to reopen as untimely and barred by numerical limitations. The final administrative
decision remains the Board's September 29, 2010, dismissal of his appeal. On April 30, 2018, the
respondent filed an untimely and number-barred motion to reopen proceedings, and on July 23,
2018, the respondent filed an untimely motion to reconsider and terminate proceedings. See
sections 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; 8 U.S.C. $$ 1229a(c)(7)(A),
(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.2(b), (c)(2). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not
responded to these motions.

We first address the respondent's motion requesting reconsideration and termination of
proceedings. A party seeking reconsideration requests that the original decision be reexamined in
light of alleged legal or factual errors, a change of law, or an argument or aspect of the case that
was overlooked. See Malter of O-S-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 56 (BIA 2006); Matter of Cerna, 20 I&N
Dec. 399 (BIA 1991). The respondent contends that his proceedings should be terminated in light
of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). In
particular, the respondent claims that his Notice to Appear (Form I-862) was defective because it
failed to designate the date and time of his hearing as required under section 239(a) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a). Accordingly, the respondent argues, the
filing of the Notice to Appear with the Immigration Court in his case was insufficient to vest
jurisdiction with the Immigration Court.
The decision Pereira v. Sessions involved the “stop-time" rule in cancellation of removal
cases. The respondent asserts that the decision should not be limited to such cases, but should be
applied to all Notices to Appear that do not include the time and place of the hearing. However,
as this Board recently explained in Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec. 441 (BIA 2018), a
Notice to Appear that does not specify the time or place of an alien's initial removal hearing vests
an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings, and meets the requirements
of section 239(a) of the Act, so long as a notice of hearing specifying this information is later sent
to the alien. The record indicates that the respondent subsequently received proper notices of his
removal hearings, which specified the dates, times, and locations of his scheduled hearings, and
that he attended these hearings. Consequently, the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act were
satisfied in this case, and termination is unwarranted.

We next turn to the respondent's motion to reopen proceedings. The respondent continues to
argue that he is a Chaldean Christian and that reopening is warranted based on changed conditions
in Iraq material to his eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the
Convention Against Torture. The time limitation for motions to reopen does not apply to a motion
to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum, based on changed country conditions, if
such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented
at the former hearing. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997).
The motion must state the new facts to be proved and must be supported by evidentiary material.
Id. The alien must show a "reasonable likelihood of success on the merits so as to make it
worthwhile to develop the issues further at a full evidentiary hearing.” Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-,
22 I&N Dec. 953 (BIA 1999).
We find that the respondent's motion warrants reopening for changed country conditions. 8
C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Along with the current motion, the respondent has submitted a Form I-
589, additional evidence which he alleges corroborates his Chaldean ethnicity and his Christian
religion, and updated country condition evidence for Iraq. He argues that he received this personal
information regarding his religion through a Freedom of Information Act request, and that the
information overcomes the Immigration Judge's 2008 adverse credibility finding (IJ at 17-18).
Given the lack of DHS opposition, in conjunction with current conditions in Iraq and the
respondent's claim that the proffered evidence regarding his Christianity was at least
constructively known to the DHS, we will remand the record to allow the respondent to present
his application for relief from removal. The following orders will, thus, be entered.

ORDER: The respondent's motion to reconsider and terminate is denied.
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent's motion to reopen is granted, and the record is
remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.
