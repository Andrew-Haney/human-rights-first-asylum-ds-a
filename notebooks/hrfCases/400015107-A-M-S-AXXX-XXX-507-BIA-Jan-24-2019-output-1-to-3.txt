IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Benjamin L. Simpson, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Elizabeth Collins
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Convention Against Torture
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appeals from the Immigration Judge's decision
dated June 18, 2018, which granted the respondent's application for deferral of removal under the
Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c)(4), (d)(2), 1208.17(a).' The parties have
provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be dismissed.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, and judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent, a native and citizen of the Dominican
Republic, met his burden to prove that a gang perceived him as supporting a rival gang; that the
gang had threatened him in the past and was interested in harming or killing him should he be
deported; that the gang would likely find out if he was in fact deported to the Dominican Republic;
and that the govemment of the Dominican Republic would acquiesce to the gang torturing or
killing the respondent (IJ at 2-3, 4-5). We will affirm the Immigration Judge's decision.
Although we acknowledge the arguments on appeal, the DHS does not establish that the
Immigration Judge's determination on the respondent's credibility, considering the totality of the
circumstances, was clearly erroneous. DHS’s Br. at 15-20. See section 240(c)(4)(C) of the Act,
8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(C); Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 2008). See also section
208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260
(BIA 2007). Also, in addition to his testimony, the respondent provided other evidence to establish
1
We acknowledge that the respondent argues that service of the Notice of Appeal was defective.
See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.3(a)(1). In order to resolve the matter, and given that the respondent has had
ample opportunity to proffer his arguments on appeal, the Board takes the appeal on certification.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(c).

the gang's continued interest in harming or killing him (Exhs. 4 at Tabs B and C, 16 at Tabs S, T,
W, 20 at Tab B). DHS’s Br. at 21. The DHS cites no pertinent legal authority to support the
suggestion that the respondent was required to report the threats he received to the police. DHS’s
Br. at 23. We are similarly unpersuaded by the argument that certain actions by police in the
Dominican Republic overcome other evidence the Immigration Judge cited in finding likely
government acquiescence.? DHS's Br. at 23-24. See De La Rosa v. Holder, 598 F.3d 103, 109-
11 (2d Cir. 2010). Family members remaining in the country unharmed diminishes a fear of future
harm but only insofar as those family members are similarly situated to the respondent. DHS's
Br. at 22. See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, 191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir. 1999). Thus, we will dismiss
the DHS's appeal of the Immigration Judge's decision. The record will be remanded to allow the
DHS an opportunity to perform or update a background and security investigation. Accordingly,
the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The DHS's appeal is dismissed.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the DHS the opportunity to complete or update
identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations, and further proceedings, if
necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(h).

FOR THEBOARD
In this regard, we note that the Immigration Judge accepted evidence from Dr. Brotherton as
evidence of a lay witness with specialized knowledge of conditions in the Dominican Republic
(IJ at 3). DHS’s Br. at 24-25.
