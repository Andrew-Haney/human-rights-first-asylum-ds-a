IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS:
Ramiro J. Lluis, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
This case was last before us on November 21, 2018, when we dismissed the respondents'!
appeal from an Immigration Judge's decision dated September 28, 2017, which denied all forms
of relief. On September 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted
the Goverment's motion to remand this matter for further proceedings addressing the
respondent's applications for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3). See Ninth Circuit's
Remand at 1-2. The Ninth Circuit's order identified a need for additional analysis as to the
respondents' proposed particular social group, on which they relied for their claim to relief. For
the following reasons, we will remand the record for further proceedings.

The Ninth Circuit notes that the respondent's appeal raises her membership in the particular
social group of “Guatemalan married women viewed as property by virtue of their position within
a domestic relationship who are unable to leave the relationship.” In our November 2018 order,
we applied the Attorney General's decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018),
which vacated a previous Board decision finding cognizable an analogous group. The Ninth
Circuit's remand indicates that further findings are necessary on the issues of the particularity and
social distinction of the respondent's proposed group.

We observe that in Matter of A-B-, the Attomey General stated that “[s]ocial groups
defined by their vulnerability to private criminal activity likely lack the particularity required
under M-E-V-G-, (26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014)], given that broad swaths of society may be
susceptible to victimization.” Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 335. The Attorney General also
determined that “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship” was not
The lead respondent is an adult female (A202-140-748) and the co-respondent is her minor child.
References hereafter to “the respondent” refer to the lead respondent.
2 The Ninth Circuit's order does not disturb our prior determination that the respondent did not
establish eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
3 Matter of A-B- vacated Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014).

proven to have the “social distinction” to be a particular social group, citing “significant room
for doubt that Guatemalan society views these women ... as members of a distinct group ...
rather than each as a victim of a particular abuser in highly individualized circumstances.” Matter
of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 336.
Given that the Attorney General's decision was issued after the Immigration Judge denied the
respondent's applications for relief, and in view of the Ninth Circuit's order remanding this record,
we will remand the record to give the Immigration Judge an opportunity to make factual findings
regarding the social distinction and particularity of the respondent's proposed particular social
group, considering the guidance in Matter of A-B-24
The following order is therefore entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.

Although the respondent argued on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have interpreted
her claim as impliedly raising other particular social groups, such as “women in Guatemala” and
“family,” we declined to consider these groups for the first time on appeal. Matter of W-Y-C- &
H-O-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 189 (BIA 2018). The Ninth Circuit's remand does not disturb this part of
our November 2018 order.
