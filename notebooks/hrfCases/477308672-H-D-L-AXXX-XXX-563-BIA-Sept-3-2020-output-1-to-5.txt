In re: H
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Michael S. Henry, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Jon D. Staples
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Convention Against Torture
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge's August 22, 2019, decision ordering him
removed from the United States to his native Vietnam. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(b)(3) (2019). The
Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
The respondent was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1980. In
1999, he was convicted of attempted murder in Pennsylvania and sentenced to an indeterminate
term of imprisonment of from 20 to 40 years. There is no dispute that this conviction renders him
removable and ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. Thus, the only issue on appeal
is whether the Immigration Judge properly denied the respondent's application for deferral of
removal to Vietnam under the Convention Against Torture, see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.17.

To qualify for deferral of removal, the respondent must prove that he will “more likely than
not” suffer “torture” if returned to Vietnam. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). In this context, “torture"
means "an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment” by which "severe pain or suffering,
whether physical or mental,” is intentionally inflicted upon a person “by or at the instigation of or
with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.”
8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1)-(2). What will happen to the respondent if removed to Vietnam is a
question of predictive fact for the Immigration Judge to decide and for this Board to review for
clear error; however, whether what will happen to the respondent qualifies as “torture” is a legal
question that we review de novo. Kaplun v. Att'y Gen. of U.S., 602 F.3d 260, 271 (3d Cir. 2010).
In support of his claim, the respondent credibly testified that he participated in anti-government
resistance activities in Vietnam during the late 1970s, when he was a teenager.' In 1978, while
engaging in those activities, the respondent was arrested by government forces and imprisoned for
about a month and half, during which he was systematically tortured, including through the
application of electric shocks, beatings through books (to prevent bruising), water torture, and
involuntary administration of drugs. Eventually the respondent was hospitalized, but with the help
of a nurse he escaped from the hospital, eluded pursuit, and managed to exit Vietnam unlawfully
| The credibility of the respondent's testimony is undisputed (IJ at 7).

in 1979, coming shortly thereafter to the United States, where he has lived ever since as a lawful
permanent resident (IJ at 4-5; Tr. at 41, 45-46, 50-51, 59, 69-72, 74-78). During the late 1990s,
the respondent became an active supporter of the Government for Free Vietnam (“GFVN”), an
anti-communist “government-in-exile” based in the United States (IJ at 5-6; Tr. at 80-85).
In light of his past torture, his unlawful escape from Vietnam, his refugee status in the
United States, his GFVN affiliation, and his very serious criminal record, the respondent fears that
he will be subjected to intense scrutiny by security forces upon his return to Vietnam, and that he
will be interrogated, imprisoned, and tortured as a suspected opponent of the regime.
In support of his claim, the respondent submitted country conditions evidence, including the
2018 State Department Human Rights Report for Vietnam, which indicates that “mistreatment and
torture by police” is “commonly reported” by detainees in Vietnam, that “[p]olice and plainclothes
authorities routinely mistreated, harassed, and assaulted activists,” that “[p]rison officials singled
out political prisoners for harsher treatment and subjected them to extreme harassment from
both prison authorities and other inmates," that “[i ormer political prisoners reported that police
beat individuals in custody with books to prevent visible bruising,” deprived political prisoners of
adequate food, and “subjected political prisoners to ... extended periods of solitary confinement”
(Exh. 10, at 2-4).
A 2014 Report from the Campaign to Abolish Torture in Vietnam, which was based on
interviews with 60 former political and religious prisoners in Vietnam, likewise described torture
of detainees as “pervasive” and “systematic,” occurring most frequently when detainees are
interrogated while incommunicado and before the attachment of legal protections or judicial
supervision (Exh. 7, passim). Many of the methods of torture described in this report closely
resemble those used against the respondent in the late 1970s, including isolation, water torture, the
use of electric shocks, and the involuntary administration of mind-altering drugs (Exh. 7, at 12-13,
28-36, 41-43, 48-50). Other media reports indicate that the Vietnamese government interrogates
and prosecutes Vietnamese nationals who are repatriated after applying unsuccessfully for asylum
abroad (Exh. 6, at 74-78), and that dozens of GFVN activists have been tried and imprisoned in
Vietnam on “terrorism” charges (Exh. 6, at 85-96).

The Immigration Judge acknowledged this evidence and the credibility of the respondent's
testimony, but nevertheless found it “insufficient to indicate that ſtorture is] systematic [in
Vietnam) or used on every individual who has made a political asylum claim” (IJ at 9). Though
the Immigration Judge recognized that “political prisoners are more likely than not to suffer some
form of abuse,” he determined that he could not find that such would necessarily amount to
torture” (IJ at 9). Further, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not met his burden
to prove that “he would more likely than not be detained and determined to be a political dissident
upon removal to Vietnam” (IJ at 9). In support of this latter finding, the Immigration Judge noted
that the respondent's arrest and torture in Vietnam occurred long ago, that some of his sibling had
returned to Vietnam for visits without being detained or harmed, and that the respondent's GFVN
activities were not “major” enough to attract the attention of Vietnamese authorities (IJ at 9-11).
We respectfully conclude that the Immigration Judge clearly erred when he found that the
respondent does not face a probability of detention, interrogation, and abuse if removed to

Vietnam. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The respondent is a victim of past torture in Vietnam who
left the country illegally, was admitted to the United States as a refugee, openly joined a notorious
organization of anti-communist Vietnamese expatriates in the United States, and then sustained a
conviction for attempted murder for which he has spent decades in prison. Even if it is conceivable
that a person with one or two of these unique characteristics might hope to escape the negative
attention of the Vietnamese authorities upon removal, it is highly implausible that someone who
combines all of them could hope to do so. The Immigration Judge's contrary finding was clearly
erroneous because he did not examine the respondent's risk factors in the aggregate. Kamara
v. Att 'y Gen. of U.S., 420 F.3d 202, 213-14 (3d Cir. 2005) (explaining that an applicant “is entitled
to CAT protection if he is able to demonstrate that the cumulative probability of torture” from all
sources or for all reasons exceeds 50%); see also Rodriguez-Arias v. Whitaker, 915 F.3d 968, 973
(4th Cir. 2019); Quijada-Aguilar v. Lynch, 799 F.3d 1303, 1308 (9th Cir. 2015).
Though some of the respondent’s siblings were able to return to Vietnam for visits without
being harmed or interrogated, we agree with the respondent that these siblings are not similarly
situated to him. When the respondent's siblings traveled to Vietnam, they were cloaked with the
protection of United States citizenship and had obtained visas authorizing them to visit
temporarily; they were not Vietnamese citizens being involuntarily repatriated for permanent
resettlement due to serious criminal convictions. Furthermore, the siblings who have returned to
Vietnam had never been tortured in the past by the Vietnamese regime, nor did they escape from
official custody, participate in GFVN activities, or spend decades in prison for attempted murder.
Upon de novo review, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii), we also conclude that the abuse the
respondent is likely to receive from the Vietnamese authorities will more likely than not rise to the
level of “torture” within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1). All of the country conditions
evidence of record—including the State Department's 2018 Human Rights Report-substantiates
that the torture of detainees by Vietnam's security forces is routine, systematic and pervasive,
especially when the detainees are suspected of holding subversive opinions. Given the
respondent's very serious criminal record and his history of anti-communist activity in Vietnam
and the United States, we have no reason to believe that he will be treated more gently.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
In conclusion, the respondent qualifies for deferral of removal to Vietnam under 8 C.F.R.
$ 1208.17. We will therefore sustain the respondent's appeal, vacate the Immigration Judge's
decision in part, and remand the record for the completion of background checks.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the Immigration Judge's decision is vacated in part, and the
respondent's application for deferral of removal under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.17 is approved.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
opportunity to complete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or

during the late 1970s, where he claims to have suffered torture (Exh. 6, at 50-52). However, that
brother is now a United States citizen and has not returned to Vietnam since his escape in 1978.
