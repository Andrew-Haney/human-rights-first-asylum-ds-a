In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Cecile H. Nantchouang, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Gwendolyn T.D. Franks
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cameroon, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated September 6, 2018, which denied his applications for asylum under section 208 of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, but granted withholding of removal under
section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231. The appeal will be sustained.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the clearly erroneous standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, and judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent was credible and statutorily eligible for
asylum, but did not establish that he merits asylum in the exercise of discretion. On appeal, the
respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in failing to consider and weigh all relevant
favorable and adverse factors before denying asylum in the exercise of discretion (Brief at 3). See
Kalubi v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1134 (9th Cir. 2004). The Immigration Judge's decision focused on
evidence that the respondent had submitted a visa application in 2017, before the events which
form the basis of his claim for asylum, wherein he falsely attested that he was an actor in order to
improve his chances of obtaining a visa to attend a school to study theatre arts (IJ at 2). When the
visa was denied, the Immigration Judge cited to evidence that the respondent persisted in his
attempted fraud by appealing the decision (IJ at 2). However, an applicant's entry into the United
States using false documentation is worth little if any weight in balancing positive and negative
factors. See Mamouzian v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 1129, 1138 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that such
deception rather supports than detracts from a claim to fear persecution). Further,
misrepresentations by genuine refugees may be wholly consistent with a fear of persecution and
are not, by themselves, a reason for denial of asylum. See Akinmade v. INS, 196 F.3d 951, 955
(9th Cir. 1999).
The Immigration Judge also cited to the respondent's acknowledgement that he traveled
through twelve countries on his way to the United States without seeking asylum in any of those
countries, and intentionally discarded his passport to avoid deportation in Guatemala (IJ at 2, 7).

On appeal, the respondent argues that his case is similar to the facts in Gulla v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d
911 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding the Immigration Judge's discretionary denial of asylum based on the
fact that he traveled through several other countries without seeking asylum, used fraudulent
documents to get to the United States, and circumvented the usual process, was an abuse of
discretion). See also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.15 (setting forth the criteria for determining whether an alien
should be considered firmly resettled in another country). The Department of Homeland Security
argues in the brief on appeal that Gulla is distinguishable from the present facts because in this
case the respondent lied to immigration officials before he suffered the harm that formed the basis
of his asylum claim. We do not agree. The Immigration Judge found the respondent was credible
in his testimony that Anglophones were being oppressed in Cameroon prior to his personal
experience with such persecution, such that he warranted a grant of withholding of removal. The
timing of his personal experience with that persecution is not enough to outweigh the positive
factors in this case which support his application for asylum.
Given the respondent's clear opposition to the authorities, the respondent's credible testimony
as to his past persecution based on his political opinion, and the Immigration Judge's positive
credibility finding, we conclude that the respondent has established eligibility for asylum based on
his well-founded fear of being persecuted on account of his political opinion.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.

FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
opportunity to complete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or
examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by
8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(h).
