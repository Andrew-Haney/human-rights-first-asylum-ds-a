IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Gregory Romanovsky, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondents are natives and citizens of Indonesia. They have filed an untimely motion to
reopen, alleging changed country conditions for Christians in their country of origin.' The
Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's requests for relief, but found the respondent's
testimony credible and specifically noted the validity of his religious beliefs as a member of the
Christian faith (IJ at 6). In his motion, the respondent contends that he remains a Christian and
that reopening is warranted due to a recent increase in religious intolerance and religiously
motivated violence against Christians in his native country of Indonesia.

The respondent asserts that Muslim extremists now target Christians and that it is no longer
safe for Christians in Indonesia. In support of the motion, the respondent has submitted his Form
1-589, baptismal certificate and various letters of support from churches he attends in the United
States. He has also submitted extensive background evidence regarding recent conditions in
Indonesia, including an affidavit written by Jeffrey A. Winters, Ph.D.
With limited exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry
of a final administrative order of deportation or removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). There is
no time or number limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply
for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal based on changed country conditions or
circumstances arising in the country of nationality or the country to which deportation or removal
has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been
discovered or presented at the previous proceeding. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act;
8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007), affd Shao v. Mukasey,
546 F.3d 138 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953, 956 (BIA 1999).
| The respondents are a father and son. In the decision, we will refer to the lead respondent in the
singular inasmuch as the co-respondent is a rider on his father's application.

-227 et al.
Motions to reopen are disfavored and strict limits endorsed in removal proceedings where
every delay works to the advantage of an alien illegally residing in the United States who wishes
to remain. Maller of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 252. The movant must establish prima facie
eligibility for the relief sought, and has the heavy burden of demonstrating that the "new evidence
offered would likely change the result in the case." Id. at 251, quoting Maller of Coelho, 20 I&N
Dec. 464,473 (BIA 1992).
The evidence submitted with the motion is sufficient to establish changed conditions or
circumstances in Indonesia material to the respondent's eligibility for asylum, withholding of
removal, and Convention Against Torture protection. The respondent has submitted evidence
indicating that he was baptized as a Christian and is a practicing Christian, and the Immigration
Judge and this Board have previously credited the respondent's claim of being Christian (IJ at 6).
In addition, the background evidence submitted by the respondent shows that religious
extremism and violence has worsened in Indonesia against Christians. Although religious
extremism, violence, and discrimination also existed at the time of the respondent's 2005 hearing
(Exhs. 7-10), the respondent has shown materially changed circumstances for Christians in
Indonesia. See Liem v. Atly Gen., 921 F.3d 388 (3d Cir. 2019).
Based on the foregoing, the motion to reopen will be granted and the record will be remanded
for further proceedings in accordance with this decision. Accordingly, the following orders will
be entered

ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this
decision.
