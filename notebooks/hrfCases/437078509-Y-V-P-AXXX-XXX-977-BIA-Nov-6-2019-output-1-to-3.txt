IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Kaitlin DeStigter
Associate Legal Advisor
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
This case is presently before us pursuant to a February 28, 2019, order of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granting the Govemment’s motion to remand. On
August 27, 2019, we requested supplemental briefing from both parties. The Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) filed a motion to remand in lieu of a supplemental brief. The
respondent did not respond to the request for supplemental briefing. The record will be remanded
to the Immigration Court.

This case was remanded for further evaluation of whether “women in El Salvador” constitutes
a particular social group. The DHS has requested remand of the proceedings to the Immigration
Court for consideration of whether the proffered group of “women in El Salvador” meets the
particularity requirement for a particular social group and for a definitive or circumstance-specific
finding regarding social distinction. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 319 (A.G. 2018)
(quoting Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014)); see also Matter of W-G-R-,
26 I&N Dec. 208, 212-18 (BIA 2014), aff'd in pertinent part and vacated and remanded in
pertinent part on other grounds sub nom. by Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016),
cert. denied sub nom. Reyes v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 736 (2018).
Given the remand and our limited fact-finding ability, we will remand this case to the
Immigration Court. 8 C.F.R. ſ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Remand will allow the Immigration Judge
to conduct additional fact-finding that may be necessary for the required "evidence-based
inquiry” as to whether the social group of “women in El Salvador” meets the requirements of
particularity and whether that group is perceived as “distinct” in El Salvadoran society. See Matter
of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 340-41 (emphasizing the importance of Immigration Judges as
fact-finders); Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 241-44; Maller of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at
221; Pirir-Boc v. Holder, 750 F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir. 2014).
If the social group is found to be cognizable under the Act, the Immigration Judge should
consider whether the respondent has demonstrated a nexus between the social group of “women
in El Salvador” and the past harm she suffered or future harm she fears. We express no opinion
regarding the ultimate outcome of the respondent's case.
