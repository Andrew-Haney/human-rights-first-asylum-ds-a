In re: Raul GONZALEZ a.k.a. Raul Gonzalez-Ibarra
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Miguel A. Olano, Esquire
APPLICATION:
Reopening; termination
The Board entered the final administrative decision on July 16, 2014, when we dismissed the
respondent's appeal of the Immigration Judge's decision denying his applications for
asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against
Torture, and ordering him removed to Mexico. The lawful permanent resident respondent was
found removable under section 212(a)(2)(A)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), based on his February 22, 2010, cocaine possession conviction in
violation of Cal. Health & Safety Code § 11350. The respondent has now filed a motion to
reopen and terminate, based on a May 22, 2017, state court order reducing the conviction to a
misdemeanor.

The evidence reflects that the respondent's conviction is amended under Cal. Penal Code
§ 1170.18(G) to a simple drug possession misdemeanor on February 22, 2010, in violation of
Cal. Health & Safety Code $ 11350(a). Matter of Cota-Vargas, 23 I&N Dec. 849 (BIA 2005)
(recognizing that the Board gives full faith and credit to a trial court's nunc pro tunc modification
of an alien's conviction irrespective of the reasons for the modification). Further, the respondent
seeks termination of the proceedings, because his first time simple drug possession conviction is
subject to then-applicable rehabilitative expungement exception, given that Federal First Offender
Act (“FFOA”) relief would have been available for a similar federal conviction at the time. See
Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, 646 F.3d 684 (9th Cir. 2011).' The Department of Homeland Security
has not responded to the motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). Under the circumstances, we will
sua sponte grant the respondent's motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).
ORDER: The motion is granted and the proceedings are terminated without prejudice.
FOR THE BOARD

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has since abandoned, prospectively, its

precedents regarding expungements of drug convictions analogous to the FFOA.
