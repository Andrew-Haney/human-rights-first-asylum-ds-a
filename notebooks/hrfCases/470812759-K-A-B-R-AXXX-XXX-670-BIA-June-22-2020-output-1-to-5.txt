IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Mark J. Devine, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge's July 9,
2018, decision denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal under sections
208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3), as well
as protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). See 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.13, 1208.16-.18. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a motion in
opposition to the appeal. The respondent's appeal will sustained and the record remanded.
We review the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including credibility determinations,
under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues,
including issues of law, discretion, and judgment, under the de novo standard. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in determining that she was
time-barred from seeking asylum (Respondent's Br. at 6-11). The respondent also contends that
she met her burden for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against
Torture (Respondent’s Br. at 11-21).
First, we address the respondent's contention that she demonstrated an extraordinary
circumstance exempting her from asylum's one-year filing deadline. See sections 208(a)(2)(B),
(D) of the Act. In determining that the respondent was time-barred, the Immigration Judge
concluded that the respondent had not established an "exceptional circumstance” to justify an
untimely asylum application and implied that the respondent should have, but did not, make this
showing by “clear and convincing evidence” (IJ at 9). The respondent argues, however, that she
was only required to demonstrate an “extraordinary circumstance,” and only according to a
preponderance of the evidence (Respondent's Br. at 8-9). See sections 208(a)(2)(B), (D) of the
Act; see also Viridiana v. Holder, 646 F.3d 1230, 1236-37 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that
“exceptional circumstances” constitute a higher burden of proof than “extraordinary
circumstances”). Compare section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act (requiring that the respondent
demonstrate an “extraordinary circumstance” (to the satisfaction of the Attorney General"), with
Matter of Locicero, 11 I&N Dec. 805, 808 (BIA 1966) (defining the term “to the satisfaction of

Although the respondent's Form 1-589 included a rider respondent, the rider respondent did not
appeal the Immigration Judge's denial of derivative asylum. See Form EOIR-26.

the Attorney General" as a preponderance of the evidence (citing Matter of Barreiros, 10 I&N
Dec. 536, 538 (1964)).
Despite the Immigration Judge's substitution of terms, “it is clear from the record that ... [this]
was inadvertent and not a legal determination affecting the substance of this analysis.” See Lizama
v. Holder, 629 F.3d 440, 445 (4th Cir. 2011). The Immigration Judge “properly understood (the
respondent's] argument to be that her ignorance of the one-year filing deadline constituted an
“extraordinary circumstance” (IJ at 6; Tr. at 21-23). Id. However, as the Immigration Judge
correctly concluded, ignorance of the law does not constitute an “extraordinary circumstance.”
See Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5).
The respondent further contends that the Immigration Judge's time bar analysis was flawed
because it did not consider that additional circumstances prevented her from filing her Form 1-589.
For example, the respondent was only 19 year old when she entered the United States, witnessed
traumatic events 5 months before entering the United States, became pregnant with a second child
shortly after arriving in the country, and could not understand English. However, these
circumstances are not “extraordinary.” In fact, many of these circumstances, such as experiencing
traumatic events shortly before arrival to the United States and not speaking English, are common
for asylum seekers who are unexpectedly forced to flee to the United States. Moreover, the
respondent's second pregnancy does not constitute an extraordinary circumstance because she
created this circumstance. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5) (excluding circumstances that were
"created by the alien through his or her own action or inaction” from the definition
"extraordinary”).

We are also unpersuaded by the respondent's appellate argument that the Immigration Judge
should have, but did not, consider an unpublished BIA decision when determining whether the
respondent established an exception to the one-year filing deadline (Respondent's Br. at 7-12).
See 2017 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 26297 (BIA May 22, 2017). First, unpublished Board orders do
not represent binding precedent in the respondent's case. See Matter of Zangwill, 18 I&N Dec.
22, 27 (BIA 1981), overruled on other grounds, Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546 (BIA 1988).
Moreover, this unpublished order considered whether an alien who entered the United States
before reaching the age of 18 had demonstrated an “extraordinary circumstance” after failing to
apply for asylum after reaching the age of majority, which is distinguishable from the present case,
where the respondent entered the United States as a legal adult (IJ at 2; Exh. 1; Exh. 2 at 2). See
also Matter of Y-C-, 23 I&N Dec. 286, 288 (BIA 2002) (holding that even if an alien enters the
United States as an unaccompanied minor, “[w]e are not required to excuse () [her] tardy filing
merely because the regulation includes unaccompanied minor status as a possible extraordinary
circumstance.”).
Because we discern no legal or clear factual error with the Immigration Judge's determination
that the respondent had not met her burden to prove an “extraordinary circumstance,” we need not
consider her additional appellate argument that she filed for asylum within a reasonable time
period of the “extraordinary circumstance” (Respondent's Br. at 11). See See INS v. Bagamasbad,
429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (As a general rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings
on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach); see also See Matter of
A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 340 (A.G. 2018) (holding that if an “asylum application is fatally flawed

in one respect ... an [I]mmigration [J]udge or the Board need not examine the remaining elements
of the asylum claim"). Accordingly, we affirm the Immigration Judge's denial of asylum.
Next, we consider the respondent's contention that the Immigration Judge erred in denying her
withholding of removal (Respondent's Br. at 12-18). First, the respondent argues that the
Immigration Judge erred in concluding that she had not articulated a cognizable particular social
group upon which to seek withholding of removal (Respondent's Br. at 12-14). Aliens must
clearly delineate the proposed particular social group before the Immigration Judge, or waive the
issue on appeal. See W-Y-C- & H-O-B, 27 I&N Dec. 189, 192 (BIA 2018). Before the Immigration
Judge, the respondent claimed that she was seeking relief based on her membership in the proposed
particular social groups of “perceived prosecutorial witness(es) and her known identity in her
family of origin” (Tr. at 56).

An alien's proposed particular social group constitutes a protected ground under the Act if the
alien establishes that the group is (1) composed of members who share a common immutable
characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question.
Matter of M-E-V-G- 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014). Social group determinations are made
on a case-by-case basis, according to the particular factual findings in each case. Id. at 242. If the
particular social group is based on an alien's membership in her immediate family, the respondent
must demonstrate that her “specific nuclear family would be “recognizable by society at large.
See Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 581, 594 (A.G. 2019) (emphasis in original) (quoting Matter
of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 336 (A.G. 2018)); id. at 595 (“[U]nless an immediate family carries
greater societal import, it is unlikely that a proposed family-based group will be distinct in the
way required by the [Act] for purposes of asylum.”). Notably, “it is the perception of the relevant
society-rather than the perception of the alien's actual or potential persecutors-that" determines
whether a nuclear family is socially distinct. Id. at 594 (citing Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec.
208, 217 (BIA 2014)).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent's proposed particular social groups were
not legally cognizable under the Act, but did not make any factual findings to support this
determination (IJ at 10). Thus, we must remand for the Immigration Judge to make factual findings
about the cognizability of both of the respondent's proposed groups (Respondent's Br. at 15-16).
See Cordova v. Holder, 759 F.3d 332, 338 (4th Cir. 2014) (remanding a case because it did not
analyze the cognizability of the alien's purported particular social group); see also 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (“[T]he Board will not engage in fact finding in the course of deciding
appeals."). On remand, the Immigration Judge should consider whether the respondent's
perceived membership in the group of prosecutorial witnesses constitutes a particular social group
according to the facts provided in this record. Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117 (4th
Cir. 2011) (those actively opposing gangs by agreeing to be prosecutorial witnesses as well as their
family members constitute a cognizable particular social group); see also, e.g., Henriquez-Rivas
v. Holder, 707 F.3d 1081, 1092 (9th Cir. 2013) (concluding that people who testified publicly
against gang members in criminal proceedings may constitute a particular social group) (en banc);
Gashi v. Holder, 702 F.3d 130, 132 (2d Cir. 2012). The Immigration Judge should also make
factual findings to determine whether the respondent's brother's professional soccer career in
Honduras demonstrates that the respondent's "family unit would be recognizable by society at
large.'” See Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. at 594.

Likewise, although the Immigration Judge determined that there was no nexus between the
respondent’s proposed particular social groups and the harm that the respondent fears, he did not
support his conclusion with any factual findings (IJ at 10-11). Accordingly, we remand this
decision for the Immigration Judge to make factual findings about whether the respondent's
proposed particular socials groups were or would be one central reason she did or would
experience harm.
Although the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent had not demonstrated a clear
probability that she would experience harm rising to the level of persecution in the future, he did
not clearly identify the factual findings he made to support this conclusion (IJ at 11). The
respondent's brief identifies a number of alleged facts, such as her credible testimony that two of
the other witnesses were murdered, that she argues meet her burden of proof (IJ at 8; Tr. at 40;
Respondent's Br. at 17-18). For this same reason, we also remand this case to the Immigration
Judge to provide factual findings that support his finding that the respondent had not established
that she would suffer harm in the future.
Finally, the Immigration Judge should make factual findings to support his conclusion that the
respondent had not demonstrated that a government official would harm or acquiesce to her harm
(IJ at 11; Respondent's Br. at 20-21). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1), (7).
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal from the denial of asylum is denied.

FURTHER ORDER: The respondent's appeal from the denial of withholding of removal
under the Act and the Convention Against Torture is sustained, and the record is remanded.
