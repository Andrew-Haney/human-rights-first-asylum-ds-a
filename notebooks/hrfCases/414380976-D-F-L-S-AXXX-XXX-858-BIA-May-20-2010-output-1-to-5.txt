APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal
This case was last before us on August 28, 2006, when we summarily affirmed an Immigration
Judge's April 10, 2006, decision denying the respondent's applications for asylum, withholding of
removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture, and voluntary departure.' In a decision
dated December 11, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied all of the
claims for relief except that it remanded for further assessment regarding whether the respondent
could establish membership in a particular social group and therefore, eligibility for asylum and
withholding of removal. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit remanded to assess whether “Peruvians with
serious chronic mental disabilities“ constitutes a particular social group.
In his April 10, 2006, decision, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent had suffered
persecution by his mother and his mother's boyfriends in Peru (I.J. at 19-20). However, he also
Although the April 10, 2006, decision dealt with the respondent's and his father's applications for
relief, the Immigration Judge incorporated by reference his September 23, 2003, decision in which
he denied the respondent's father's suspension of deportation and voluntary departure applications
and severed the respondent's case for independent consideration. We subsequently remanded the
respondent's father's proceedings back to the Immigration Judge in 2005, based on a claim of
ineffective assistance of counsel and in order to allow the respondent's father to apply for asylum,
withholding of removal, and for protection under the Convention Against Torture. On May 12,
2005, the Immigration Judge again consolidated the respondent's and his father's cases. However,
only the respondent's case has been remanded by the Ninth Circuit.

found that the respondent had failed to show that this past persecution, or even that any future
persecution, was on account of a protected ground (I.J. at 21-22). In that regard, the Immigration
Judge held that the respondent failed to establish a nexus between any persecution and the
respondent's status as a chronically mentally disabled person in Peru (I.J. at 20-21).
The Immigration Judge compared the respondent's proposed social group to the group discussed
in Tchoukhrova v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 1181 (9th Cir. 2005) (1.J. at 20-21). In that case, the Ninth
Circuit concluded that Russian children with disabilities that are serious and long-lasting or
permanent in nature and parents who care for them qualify as a particular social group.? Id. The
Immigration Judge found that case distinguishable from the respondent's, however, because (1) the
disability here is mental as opposed to physical and it is not clear that the respondent's disability is
permanent, and (2) the respondent could not establish the same level of stigmatization and denial of
basic human rights that the alien in Tchoukhrova was able to show (I.J. at 21). Finally, the
Immigration Judge noted that the respondent's proposed social group of people who have
psychological problems "includes too broad a spectrum of society” (I.J. at 21).
Since the Immigration Judge appears to have already addressed the issue ded by the
Ninth Circuit, we interpret the court's remand order as a directive to reconsider. Cf. Gonzales
v. Thomas, supra (requiring a remand so that the Board can consider the issue of membership in a
particular social group rather than having the circuit court decide the question de novo). This is not
unreasonable in light of recent case precedent issued by the Board which provides additional
guidance on assessing membership in a particular social group. See Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-,
24 I&N Dec. 69 (BIA 2007); Matter of C-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 951 (BIA 2006); see also Donchev
v. Mukasey, 553 F.3d 1206 (9th Cir. 2009).

In order to establish membership in a group of persons, there must be an immutable or common
characteristic which is shared by the members which they either cannot change or should not be
required to change because it is "fundamental to their individual identities or consciences." Matter
of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985). As noted, we have recently added to this definition
of “membership in a particular social group" the requirement that a purported social group have a
particular and well-defined boundary, and that the group possess a recognized level of social
visibility. See Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-, supra; Matter of C-A-, supra.
Upon reconsideration, we find the respondent's group is a particular social group. Mental
disabilities are clearly immutable characteristics in that those suffering from them cannot change
their disability. Furthermore, people with serious and chronic mental disabilities are socially visible
and the evidence of record establishes that they are often discriminated against and treated in an
inhumane manner (see, e.g., Exhs. 8R, 10A, 14). Indeed, the respondent testified to many instances
of abuse which the Immigration Judge found constituted past persecution. See Matter of C-A-,
supra, at 960 (stating that although a social group cannot be defined exclusively based on being
2 The Ninth Circuit's decision was ultimately vacated by the United States Supreme Court because,
like the case at hand, it is appropriate to allow the Board to decide such legal issues in the first
instance. Gonzales v. Tchoukhrova, 549 U.S. 801 (2006) (vacating and remanding in light of
Gonzales v. Thomas, 547 U.S. 183 (2006)). This is the reason for the current remand as well.

targeted for persecution, persecutory action toward the group may be a factor in determining its
social visibility).
All of these factors lead us to conclude that this case is not as easily distinguishable from
Tchoukhrova as suggested by the Immigration Judge. In addition, the respondent has attached to his
appeal an unpublished 2007 Board decision in which we held that Peruvian psychiatric patients with
serious and chronic mental illness can form a particular social group. While not binding, the case
appears to have substantial similarities to the respondent's case. In particular, both cases contain
evidence that mentally disabled persons are stigmatized and often subjected to substandard treatment
including being forced to undergo electroconvulsive therapy without anesthesia.
Because we find that the respondent has established past persecution on account of membership
in a particular social group, we will remand to give the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
an opportunity to rebut the presumption that the respondent has established a well-founded fear of
future persecution. We decline to render an opinion on the issue of future persecution at this time.
However, even if the DHS does rebut the presumption, we also direct the Immigration Judge to
evaluate whether the respondent qualifies for humanitarian relief under 8 C.F.R.S 1208.13(b)(1)(iii).
ORDER: The record of proceedings is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
order.

DISSENTING OPINION: Roger A. Pauley
I respectfully dissent. The majority's finding that "Peruvians with serious chronic mental
disabilities" constitutes a particular social group is at odds with our precedents. Such a class of
persons meets neither the particularity nor social visibility requirements as outlined in our cases.
Serious chronic mental disabilities take many forms, and produce symptoms ranging from
individuals who constantly "act out" or are violent to individuals who are almost perpetually
homebound due to fear, or silent, such that the particularity element of the purported social group
is not satisfied. Moreover, the majority's statement that “people with serious and chronic mental
disabilities are socially visible” is a pure ipse dixit assertion that is both unsupported by any
authority and untrue. Many persons have serious mental disabilities that go unremarked and
untreated, and those who suffer from them (including serial killers or rapists) are able to function
in society without their illnesses being noticed, until (if ever) they are caught and prosecuted for
their crimes.

The majority's decision appears to be based in large measure upon the respondent's sympathetic
circumstances. But expanding the contours of a particular social group is not an appropriate
response. The respondent's proposed group does not qualify him for asylum relief. Any expansion
of such eligibility is for policymakers in Congress, not this Board.
