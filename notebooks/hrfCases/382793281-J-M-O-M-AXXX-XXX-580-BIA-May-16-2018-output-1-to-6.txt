IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Benjamin J. Osorio, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent is a native and citizen of Honduras. This case was last before the Board on
September 7, 2017, when we remanded the record to the Immigration Judge to consider the
respondent's claims to relief or protection from removal based on his mental health condition.'
On December 8, 2017, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent's applications for asylum
under section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158; withholding of
removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3); and protection under the
Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The respondent appeals the
Immigration Judge's decision. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded
to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, in part, and the record remanded to the Immigration
Judge.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent claims he is eligible for asylum and related protection from removal because
he was and will be persecuted in Honduras on account of his membership in a particular social
group comprised of “Hondurans with severe, permanent bipolar disorder who exhibit erratic
behavior.” He challenges the Immigration Judge's determination that his proposed group
was not a cognizable particular social group (Respondent's Br. at 23-28). He further
challenges the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility determinations (Respondent’s Br. at
11-20). Additionally, he argues that the Immigration Judge erred in not assessing his claim of past
persecution and in determining that he did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution in
Honduras (Respondent's Br. at 20-22, 28-29). Finally, he challenges the Immigration Judge's
denial of his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture (Respondent's Br.
at 31-33).

In our September 7, 2017, decision, we found no clear error in the Immigration Judge's
determination that the respondent was competent for the purposes of these removal proceeding.
See Matter of J-S-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 679 (BIA 2015). That determination is not at issue here.

Upon de novo review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent did not
establish a cognizable particular social group (IJ at 14-16). See Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N
Dec. 388, 390 (BIA 2014) (holding that the question of whether a group is a “particular social
group” is a question of law that the Board reviews de novo). Rather, the record establishes that
“Hondurans with severe, permanent bipolar disorder who exhibit erratic behavior” satisfies the
immutability, particularity, and social distinction requirements. See, e.g., Temu v. Holder,
740 F.3d 887, 892-97 (4th Cir. 2014) (concluding that “individuals with bipolar disorder who
exhibit erratic behavior” was a cognizable particular social group); Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N
Dec. 227 (BIA 2014); Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014), vacated in part by
Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, Reyes v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 736
(2018). The record reflects that the respondent has a mental health diagnosis of bipolar disorder,
which is an immutable characteristic he cannot change, even though medication may
control his symptoms (Exhs. 9-10). See Temu v. Holder, 740 F.3d at 896-97; Matter of W-G-R-,
26 I&N Dec. at 212-13.
The respondent's proposed group is also defined with particularity. As the Immigration Judge
acknowledged, bipolar disorder is a recognized mental illness characterized by a common set of
symptoms (IJ at 14-15). This established medical definition and common set of symptoms
provides definable boundaries which create a clear benchmark for determining who falls within
the respondent's proposed group. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 239; Matter of W-G-R-,
26 I&N Dec. at 213-14. The fact that the average lay person may not be able to accurately diagnose
an individual who suffers from bipolar disorder does not, as the Immigration Judge erroneously
concludes, make the definition subjective or the group amorphous (IJ at 15). Additionally,
although the Immigration Judge found there are different categories of bipolar disorder (IJ at 15),
this does not make the proposed group of “Hondurans with severe, permanent bipolar disorder
who exhibit erratic behavior” overbroad.

Finally, the respondent's proposed group satisfies the social distinction requirement.
Social distinction does not mean ocular visibility. Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 238;
Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 216. Thus, contrary to the Immigration Judge's decision, the
fact that members of Honduran society may not be able to identify the respondent's erratic
behavior as being a result of his bipolar disorder—as opposed to the result of some other mental
illness or simply erratic behavior not caused by mental illness—is not fatal to the respondent's
claim (IJ at 15-16). The record contains evidence that mental illness is stigmatized in Honduras
and mentally ill individuals are subjected to degrading treatment, thus establishing that Honduran
society perceives, considers, or recognizes people sharing the particular characteristics of the
proposed group as distinct within society (Exh. 5, Tab C at 29-30; Exh. 8, Tabs K, P). See
Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 217.

Regarding the Immigration Judge's findings as to the credibility of the respondent's witnesses,
we conclude based upon the totality of the evidence that the Immigration Judge's
adverse credibility determinations were clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see
Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985) (noting that a finding is “clearly
erroneous” when based on the entire evidence the reviewing court is left with “the definite and
firm conviction that a mistake has been committed”). An adverse credibility determination must
be based on the totality of the evidence and must be supported by specific and cogent reasons

derived from the record. Section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act; Singh v. Sessions, 880 F.3d 220, 225
(5th Cir. 2018). It cannot be based on pure speculation or conjecture. Mwembie v. Gonzales,
443 F.3d 405, 410 (5th Cir. 2006).
The Immigration Judge does not identify specific and cogent reasons for finding the testimony
of the respondent's son during the December 8, 2017, hearing not credible. The Immigration
Judge found the son's testimony that the respondent and his wife would live with him if the
respondent were released not credible based on the Immigration Judge's speculation that the son
would not have room for the respondent in his house, would not be able to care for the respondent
given that the son works full-time, and the Immigration Judge's assumption that because the
respondent's wife does not currently live with this son, she and the respondent would not live with
him in the future (IJ at 6 n.3, 8 n.7, 9 n.10). These speculations and assumptions are not a valid
basis for an adverse credibility finding. See Mwembie v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d at 410.
The Immigration Judge also did not identify specific and cogent reasons for finding the
testimony of the respondent's wife not credible. The Immigration Judge found problematic the
wife's general statement that she took her husband to the mental health hospital in Tegucigalpa on
a monthly basis starting in 1982 (IJ at 10 n.11). To the extent the Immigration Judge considered
this statement inconsistent with her testimony that the respondent went to the United States for
approximately 1 year in 2004, the Immigration Judge did not give the witness the opportunity to
explain the perceived inconsistency. See Singh v. Sessions, 880 F.3d at 225. Additionally, we do
not consider these statements inconsistent. The witness was asked by DHS counsel how many
years she took her husband to the hospital on a monthly basis and answered that it had been since
1982 (Tr. at 41). She was not asked whether there were any months during that over 30-year
period that she did not take her husband to the hospital. When she was later questioned about the
respondent's 2004 trip to the United States, she testified that the respondent went without her
knowledge and that when he returned, she resumed her monthly trips with him to Tegucigalpa
(Tr. at 48-51). Because the witness was never asked nor did she state that there were no breaks in
her monthly trips to Tegucigalpa, her testimony was not inconsistent. Thus, the Immigration Judge
clearly erred in basing his adverse credibility determination on this perceived inconsistency.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).

Tuming to the issue of corroboration, the Immigration Judge identified various aspects of the
respondent's son's and wife's testimony that were not corroborated by documentary evidence. See
section 208(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act. Specifically, he found that the record lacked corroboration
regarding the respondent and his wife's lack of a car in Honduras, the travel distance by bus
between the respondent's hometown and the mental health hospital, the location of the
respondent's brother, and the neglect and maltreatment the respondent suffered during the time he
was an inpatient at the mental health hospital in Honduras (IJ at 5 n.2, 7 n.5, 8 n.6, 9 n.9).
Although the respondent bears the burden to provide reasonably available evidence to corroborate
his claim for asylum and related relief, the Immigration Judge did not give the respondent the
opportunity to explain the unavailability of documentary evidence corroborating the witnesses'
testimony. See Matter of L-A-C., 26 I&N Dec. 516, 519 (BIA 2015) (“If the evidence is
unavailable, the Immigration Judge must afford the applicant an opportunity to explain its
unavailability and ensure that the explanation is included in the record.”).

Having considered the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factors, we conclude that
the Immigration Judge clearly erred in finding the testimony of the respondent's son and his wife
not credible.2 Section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). Because the
witnesses testified about harm suffered by the respondent in Honduras because of his mental
illness, remand is necessary for the Immigration Judge to make factual findings and analyze the
respondent's claim of past persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1); see Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N
Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (noting that the Board has limited fact-finding authority).
We also find it appropriate to remand proceedings because the Immigration Judge did not make
sufficient factual findings regarding the harm the respondent will likely suffer in Honduras because
of his mental illness. See Matter of A-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 774, 790-91 (A.G. 2005) (noting the Board
has broad authority to remand a case to the Immigration Judge to ensure that the Board “is not
denied essential facts that bear on the appropriate resolution of a case”). It is not clear from the
Immigration Judge's decision that he adequately considered all the evidence in the record,
including the extensive medical documentation of the respondent's condition and the country
conditions evidence regarding mental health treatment in Honduras (Exh. 8, Tabs K-Q;
Exhs. 9-10). See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. at 465 (noting that the Immigration Judge must
make comprehensive findings of fact); Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468, 477 (BIA 1999) (holding
that the Immigration Judge is responsible for the substantive completeness of the decision).
The Immigration Judge mischaracterizes the respondent's well-founded fear of persecution
claim as being based on a fear that he will not have access to necessary medication and mental
health treatment, which the Immigration Judge concludes does not constitute persecution on
account of a protected ground (IJ at 21). See Khan v. Att 'y Gen. of U.S., 691 F.3d 488, 499
(3d Cir. 2012). The respondent, however, contends that he will be intentionally hammed or abused
by authorities because of his mental illness (Respondent's Br. at 34). On remand, the Immigration
Judge should address—after considering the documentary evidence regarding the treatment of
mentally ill individuals in Honduras—the respondent's claim that the police will harm him because
of his erratic behavior and that he will be forcibly restrained, subjected to unsanitary conditions,
and otherwise abused at a govemment-operated mental health facility (Exh. 8, Tabs K-Q;
Respondent's Br. at 34).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Immigration Judge should also reconsider the issue of internal relocation. If an alien
establishes past persecution, or fears future persecution by a govemment agent, it is presumed that
intemal relocation is not reasonable and the burden shifts to the DHS to establish that it would be
reasonable for the alien to relocate. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(3)(ii). To the extent the respondent
fears persecution by the police or a govemment agent, the Immigration Judge must determine
whether the DHS has satisfied its burden of proving that the respondent could avoid persecution
by relocating within Honduras and that relocation would be reasonable. On remand, the
2 On appeal, the respondent once again challenges the adverse credibility determination in the
Immigration Judge's March 22, 2017, decision (Respondent's Br. at 12-14). Because the
Immigration Judge's December 8, 2017, decision does not address the credibility of the
respondent's daughter and other son with respect to the instant asylum claim, we need not address
the respondent's arguments.

Immigration Judge should consider the respondent's argument on appeal that he could not avoid
persecution by relocating because regardless of where in Honduras he lives, his condition will
eventually become uncontrolled, which will lead either to his involuntary commitment in a mental
health facility or his detention and abuse by police because of his erratic behavior
(Respondent's Br. at 31).
If necessary, the Immigration Judge should also consider on remand whether the respondent
has satisfied his burden of proving eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
8 C.F.R. 88 1208.16(c), 1208.18.
Turning to the respondent's argument on appeal that the Immigration Judge was biased against
him, we do not find it necessary to remand this case to a different Immigration Judge
(Respondent's Br. at 9-11). See Matter of Y-S-L-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2015). Although the
errors the respondent identifies in the Immigration Judge's decision are sufficient to warrant
remand in this case, we are not persuaded that they are indicative of the Immigration Judge's bias
against the respondent or asylum-seekers in general. We do not discern any unprofessional or
inappropriate conduct from the Immigration Judge during the course of these proceedings. The
Immigration Judge appears to have acted as a neutral fact-finder and reached his conclusions based
on his legal analysis in which we have identified error. The respondent does not allege that the
Immigration Judge acted inappropriately during any of the hearings or prevented him from
presenting evidence in support of his applications. Thus, we find no basis to remand to a different
Immigration Judge.

ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained in part.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.
