IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Tania P. Linares Garcia, Esquire
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
1
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from the decision of the
Immigration Judge dated April 19, 2019, denying his applications for asylum and withholding of
removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
$$ 1158, 1231(b)(3), and his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The
Department of Homeland Security has not filed a brief in opposition. The respondent's appeal
will be sustained.
We review Immigration Judges' findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion,
and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).

:
As an initial matter, the respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge's finding that
the respondent is statutorily ineligible for asylum because he filed his application more than one
year after his last arrival in the United States, and did not establish that he qualifies for an exception
to the timely filing requirement (IJ at 8). We therefore need not address this issue further.
See, e.g., Matter of Cervantes, 22 I&N Dec. 560, 561 n.1 (BIA 1999) (expressly declining to
address an issue not raised by party on appeal); Matter of Gutierrez, 19 I&N Dec. 562, 565 n.3
(BIA 1988) (same).
We next address the respondent's application for withholding of removal. Upon de novo
review, we conclude that the harm the respondent experienced in El Salvador rises to the level of
past persecution. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was a credible witness
(IJ at 7). The respondent testi that he a law school graduate who advocated for the rights of
LGBTI people and faced discrimination, harassment, and physical harm in El Salvador on account
of his status as a transgender man (IJ at 3-4; Tr. at 70-78, 82-85). The respondent stated that on
one occasion his university classmates attacked him; he suffered a fractured rib and sustained
bruises, for which he required medical attention (IJ at 4; Tr. at 72-73).
Persecution is an extreme concept, marked by the infliction of suffering or harm. .. in a way
regarded as offensive.” Li v. Ashcrofi, 356 F.3d 1153, 1158 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (internal
quotation marks omitted). We conclude that the serious physical harm the respondent experienced,
We therefore use the male
'The respondent is a transgender man who has adopted the name
pronoun to refer to him.

-622
in conjunction with the harassment and mistreatment he experienced over a period of years, rise
to the level of past persecution on account of a protected ground. See Ruano v. Ashcrofi, 301 F.3d
1155, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, 225 F.3d 1084, 1092-93
(9th Cir. 2000) (Mexican gay men with female sexual identities constitute a particular social
group), overruled on other grounds by Thomas v. Gonzales, 409 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir. 2005)
(en banc), judgment vacated by Gonzales v. Thomas, 547 U.S. 183 (2006); Avendano-Hernandez
v. Lynch, 800 F.3d 1072, 1079–80 (9th Cir. 2015).
Furthermore, we find clear error in the Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent did not
demonstrate that the persecution was inflicted either by the Salvadoran govemment or by persons
that the government was unwilling or unable to control (IJ at 10). As the Immigration Judge noted,
the respondent did not report the attack he suffered to the police (IJ at 9; Tr. at 73). However, the
respondent testified he was afraid reporting would put him in greater danger, and we are persuaded
by his argument on appeal that country conditions evidence in the record demonstrates that
reporting would have been futile. See Resp. Brief at 3-4, 17-18. The documentary evidence of
record regarding LGBTI individuals' treatment by Salvadoran police and other security forces
corroborates the respondent's assertion that the government is unable or unwilling to control
persecution. The Immigration Judge cites to the country conditions evidence regarding positive
measures the Salvadoran government has taken in recent years to protect the LGBTI population
(IJ at 10). However, the record does not establish that such legislation has translated into
significantly better protection of LGBTI persons. Rather, the documentary evidence the
respondent provided reflects that violence and discrimination against transgender individuals
continues, including at the hands of police (Exhs 4,6).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Given the evidence presented, we conclude that the respondent sufficiently demonstrated that
the persecution was inflicted by individuals that the government was unwilling or unable to
control. See Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051 (9th Cir. 2017); Ornelas-Chavez
v. Gonzales, 458 F.3d 1052, 1058 (9th Cir. 2006) (government officials and employees tacitly
accepted abuse applicant suffered on account of his female sexual identity); see also Matter of
S-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000) (concluding that an applicant suffered past persecution
even if she did not report the persecution to government authorities, where the evidence showed
that if she turned to the government for help, they would have been unable or unwilling to control
the perpetrator's conduct).
In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent has demonstrated that he suffered
past persecution on account of a protected ground, and that he therefore benefits from a
presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. See Matter of D-1-M, 24 I&N Dec. 448
(BIA 2008). Furthermore, the DHS did not sufficiently rebut the presumption under the facts
presented in this case, given the extensive country conditions evidence in the record. Therefore,
we will sustain the respondent's appeal and remand the matter solely for the required security
checks.2
? In light of our disposition of this matter, we need not address the Immigration Judge's denial of
the respondent's request for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
