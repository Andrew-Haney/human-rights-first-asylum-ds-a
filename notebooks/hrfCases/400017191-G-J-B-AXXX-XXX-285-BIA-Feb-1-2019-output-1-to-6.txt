IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Dolores Xiomara San Giorgio, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Janelle C. Cruz
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Waiver of deportability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act; asylum;
withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, has appealed from the decision of the
Immigration Judge dated October 18, 2017. In that decision, the Immigration Judge, first,
determined that the respondent is ineligible for a waiver of deportability under section
237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $ 1227(a)(1)(H) (IJ at 6-7, 11, 15-
16).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The respondent entered into a fraudulent marriage and thereby obtained admission to the
United States as an immigrant and lawful permanent residence. The Immigration Judge determined
that, while the waiver could cure the respondent's inadmissibility at the time of his admission,
section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act cannot cure his inadmissibility resulting from his fraudulent 1-751,
Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (“1-751") and his subsequent N-400, Application for
Naturalization (“N-400”), both of which were submitted after the respondent's admission as an
immigrant.
Next, the Immigration Judge made a mixed credibility finding (IJ at 10, 12, 17). While the
Immigration Judge found the respondent “for the most part credible[.]” she specifically disbelieved
his testimony that he continued to reside with his first wife until he married his second wife on
June 27, 2016 (IJ at 10, 12; Tr. at 64, 61). Finally, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent's
applications for asylum under section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. $ 1158, withholding of removal
under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and withholding of removal under the
Convention Against Torture (IJ at 12-14, 17). See 8 C.F.R. & 1208.16(c).
For the following reasons, the respondent's appeal from the denial of his 1-589, Application
for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (“I-589") will be dismissed (Exh. 5). However, his
appeal from the denial of his application for a waiver of deportability under section 237(a)(1)(H)
of the Act will be sustained. Accordingly, the record will be remanded for further proceedings
and the entry of a new decision.
We review the Immigration Judge's findings of fact under a “clearly erroneous” standard. See
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review all other
'Cite as: G-Y-B-, AXXXXX 285 (BIA Feb 1, 2015)
A
-285
issues, including issues of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo standard.' See 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
There are two issues presented on appeal. The first is whether the Immigration Judge correctly
found that the respondent has established neither a well-founded fear of “persecution” nor a clear
probability of “torture,” and thus, properly denied the respondent's 1-589. Compare 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.13(b) and Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. 439, 442-43 (BIA 1987), with 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.16(c)(2) and Matter of J-E-, 23 I&N Dec. 291, 302-03 (BIA 2002); see also Perlera-
Escobar v. Exec. Office for Immigration, 894 F.2d 1292, 1296 (11th Cir. 1990) (per curiam). In
regard to the denial of the respondent's I-589, we affirm the Immigration Judge's October 18,
2017, decision (IJ at 3, 5-6, 12-14, 17). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5).
On appeal, the respondent concedes that he has not been persecuted in Haiti in the past
(Respondent's Br. at 24; IJ at 5; Tr. at 89, 92). The respondent has indicated that, because his
parents and brother have been mistreated because of his brother's political opinion “for years(,)”
he fears that the individuals who have mistreated his family members will “impute upon him the
same political opinion of his family” (Respondent's Br. at 24, 25; Tr. at 86, 89-95).
However, the Immigration Judge's factual finding that the respondent has shown neither a
reasonable possibility of persecution nor a clear probability of torture in Haiti is not clearly
erroneous. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1465 (2017); see
also Zhou Hua Zhu v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 703 F.3d 1303, 1308 (11th Cir. 2013); Matter of Z-Z-O-, 26
I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). As reflected in the Immigration Judge's decision, the political party
that the respondent's family supports holds political power in Haiti (IJ at 6; Tr. at 91). We agree
that the respondent has not shown a well-founded fear of countrywide persecution in Haiti. See
Matter of C-A-L-, 21 I&N Dec. 754, 757 (BIA 1997); Matter of R-, 20 I&N Dec. 621, 625 (BIA
1992).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The second issue presented on appeal is whether the respondent is eligible for the section
237(a)(1)(H) waiver of deportability. By entering into a fraudulent marriage for the purpose of
circumventing the immigration laws, the respondent gained admission to the United States as a
conditional lawful permanent resident on February 13, 2011, and the removal of the conditions on
his lawful permanent residence on March 19, 2014 (IJ at 2; Tr. at 13-14, 51; Exhs. 1, 13). He
entered into the fraudulent marriage on March 29, 2010, in Haiti (Exhs. 1, 3 at p. 8).
The adverse portion of the credibility finding only pertains to the respondent's application for a
waiver of deportability, not his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. Because we
have determined, without regard to his testimony, that the respondent is eligible for the waiver of
deportability as a matter of law, we need not address the respondent's credibility in order to resolve
the appeal.
We take administrative notice that Jovenel Moïse of the Tèt Kale Party remains the president of
Haiti. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); see also Matter of R-R-, 20 I&N Dec. 547, 551 n.3 (BIA
1992) (“[T]his Board may properly take administrative notice of changes in foreign govemments.”

The respondent's marriage fraud went undetected until he submitted his N-400 on February 26,
2015 (IJ at 6-7, 16; Tr. at 66-67; Exh. 3). During the May 14, 2015, interview on the N-400, the
immigration officer determined that the respondent's marriage may be fraudulent (IJ at 6-7). As
a result, the Notice to Appear was served upon the respondent on June 15, 2015, and the removal
proceedings were initiated on September 17, 2015 (IJ at 6-7; Exhs. 1, 3). Following the initiation
of the removal proceedings, the fraudulent marriage was legally terminated on June 8, 2016, and
the respondent married the mother of his two United States citizen children on June 27, 2016 (IJ at
3-4; Exh. 4 at p. 5).
As recognized by the Immigration Judge, the respondent is eligible to waive his inadmissibility
arising under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(O)(C)(i), at the time of his
admission on February 13, 2011, pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act (IJ at 15). The
respondent has conceded that he is deportable as charged based on the marriage fraud at the time
of his admission (IJ at 15).
However, the Immigration Judge further determined that, because the respondent also utilized
the fraudulent marriage to remove the conditions on his lawful permanent residence on March 19,
2014, and to apply for naturalization on February 26, 2015, he must also (but could not) establish
eligibility for the waiver of deportability in relation to those subsequent fraudulent applications (IJ
at 11, 15-16). In addition, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent's fraudulent
income tax retums, in which he claimed joint filing status on the basis of the fraudulent marriage,
also render him ineligible for the waiver of deportability (IJ at 16).

Thus, the Immigration Judge determined that, due to the continuation of the marriage fraud
after the respondent's admission, he was not “otherwise admissible to the United States” on
February 13, 2011, for the purpose of establishing his eligibility for the 237(a)(1)(H) waiver (IJ at
8, 15). However, this determination constitutes a reversible error of law and will be set aside.
The Immigration Judge reasoned that, because section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act is only available
to waive inadmissibility arising under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act at the time of entry or
adjustment of status, the waiver is unavailable to waive the fraud committed in conjunction with
the respondent's I-751, N-400, and federal income tax returns. See generally Matter of Agour, 26
I&N Dec. 566 (BIA 2015). But this analysis overlooks that in order to obtain a section
237(a)(1)(H) waiver of the fraud committed at the time of entry or adjustment of status, the
respondent need only show that he was otherwise admissible at the time of those events. There is
no requirement of continuing admissibility up to the present time, and thus no need for a waiver
with regard to any continuing, post-entry-or-adjustment fraud that has not been charged against
the respondent. At the time of his entry or adjustment of status, the respondent was only
inadmissible under section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act for his marriage fraud committed in
conjunction with his admission on February 13, 2011, and at the time he submitted the 1-751 on
March 19, 2014. A waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) is available for both of those instances of
fraud. See Hussam F. v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 707, 726 (6th Cir. 2018); Acquaah v. Sessions,
874 F.3d 1010, 1018 & n.20 (7th Cir. 2017); Vasquez v. Holder, 602 F.3d 1003, 1015
(9th Cir. 2010).

Otherwise qualifying acts of fraud or willful misrepresentations that do not trigger
inadmissibility under section 212(a)(O)(C)(i) of the Act at the time of entry of adjustment of status
do not require a waiver of deportability under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act. Conversely, the
unavailability of a section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver for post-entry-or-adjustment fraud is immaterial
when there has been no charge relating to such fraud that would require any kind of waiver in the
first place. In other words, unless the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has charged the
respondent with deportability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act on the basis of inadmissibility
arising from fraud at the time of his entry or adjustment of status, the respondent does not need to
apply for a section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver, and absent an actual charge relating to fraud committed
after his entry or adjustment, he does not need any other kind of waiver either.
Correspondingly, the respondent's marriage fraud committed after his February 13, 2011,
admission and the subsequent removal of the conditions on his residence does not retroactively
render him otherwise inadmissible to the United States as of those dates, and therefore, ineligible
for the section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. In short, only acts of fraud or willful misrepresentations that
provide the factual basis for a charge of deportability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of the Act require
a section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. In this case, the respondent's fraudulent N-400 (like any fraud in
his income tax retums) has not rendered him inadmissible at the time of his admission on February
13, 2011, or at the time of the removal of the conditions on his residence. Hence, apart from his
marriage fraud, the respondent was “otherwise admissible to the United States” on the dates of his
entry and adjustment. Therefore, he is eligible for the section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
In summation, the fraudulent N-400 has not rendered the respondent deportable under section
237(a)(1)(A) of the Act; nor has it given rise to any other deportability charge. As a result, the N-
400 has not rendered the respondent ineligible for (or unable to benefit from) the section
237(a)(1)(H) waiver. Accordingly, we will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to
determine whether the respondent merits a favorable exercise of discretion.”
The following orders will be entered.
3 While the respondent's ongoing marriage fraud after admission has not rendered him ineligible
for the section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver, the marriage fraud remains relevant to his discretionary fitness
for relief and should be given the appropriate weight on remand. See INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, 519
U.S. 26, 30-31 (1996); Matter of Tijam, 22 I&N Dec. 408, 412 (BIA 1998); cf. Matter of Sesay,
25 I&N Dec. 431, 444 (BIA 2011) (“Issues about the validity of the qualifying marriage are also
relevant to the exercise of discretion, and the fact of the divorce and its timing may raise questions
about the bona fides of that marriage."); Matter of Sweed, 10 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 1964) (“Approval
of a visa petition to accord respondent nonquota [immediate relative) status on the basis of his
marriage to a United States citizen does not preclude denial of respondent's application for
adjustment of status under section 245, Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, in
deportation proceedings, in the exercise of discretion, based on doubt as to the bona fides of that
marriage.”). In previous cases involving the exercise of discretion, a fraudulent N-400 has been
treated as an adverse discretionary factor. See Matter of Tijam, 22 I&N Dec. at 413 (“Making
false statements under oath during the naturalization process is an extremely serious adverse
factor."); cf. Wang v. Holder, 569 F.3d 531, 538 n. 5 (5th Cir. 2009).
