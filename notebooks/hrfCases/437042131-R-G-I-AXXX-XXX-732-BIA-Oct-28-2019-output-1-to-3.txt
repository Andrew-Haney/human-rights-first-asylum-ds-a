IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Jason F. Valentin, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Michelle Morton
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Reopening; asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, has appealed from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated March 21, 2019. In that decision, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent's
untimely motion to reopen, which was filed on March 8, 2019, more than 20 years after the
respondent was ordered removed on October 15, 1998 (IJ at 1-2). See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.23(b)(1). For
the following reasons, the respondent's appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded
for further proceedings and the entry of a new decision.'

The relevant procedural history is as follows. The removal proceedings were initiated with the
filing of the Notice to Appear on August 17, 1998. Following the initial October 1, 1998, master
calendar hearing, the respondent conceded removability, waived appeal, and accepted a final order
of removal on October 15, 1998.
Although the record does not reflect exactly when, at some point after the entry of the removal
order in 1998, the respondent's physical removal to Guatemala was effectuated. According to the
respondent’s 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal submitted in support
of the March 8, 2019, motion to reopen, she illegally reentered the United States on September 28,
2001 (IJ at I n.1; Mot. to Reopen at Tab E).
On appeal, the respondent renews her claims for asylum under section 208 of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1158, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and
withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). In
addition, she renews her request for reopening in order to pursue a T nonimmigrant visa under the
Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, § 107, 114
Stat. 1464 (Oct. 28, 2000) (“VTVP") (Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; Respondent's Br. at 3). See, e.g..
Matter of Castro-Tum, 27 I&N Dec. 271, 277-78 (A.G. 2018) (discussing "administrative closure
| We note that the respondent has appended voluminous documentation to the Notice of Appeal
and her subsequent appeal brief, much of which is duplicative of the documents already included
in the Record of Proceeding. Although we cannot take new documentation into consideration on
appeal, the Immigration Judge should consider it on remand.

under the VTVP); see also section 101(a)(26) of the Act, 8 C.F.R. § 1101(a)(26) (defining
"nonimmigrant visa").
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motion to reopen because he concluded that
the October 15, 1998, removal order has previously been reinstated by the Department of
Homeland Security (“DHS”) (IJ at 2). See section 241(a)(5) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).
However, having reviewed the record of proceeding, there is no evidence that the DHS has
reinstated the prior removal order. Nor has the DHS presented any evidence of a previously
reinstated removal order in support of its motion for summary affirmance.
We agree that, were the respondent subject to reinstatement of the prior removal order, the
Immigration Judge would be without authority to reopen the removal proceedings. See section
241(a)(5) of the Act. But because there is no reinstated removal order in the record, the
Immigration Judge's conclusion that the proceedings cannot be reopened lacks foundation in law
and fact.
Under the present circumstances, therefore, we will remand the case for the Immigration Judge
to address the substantive merits of the respondent's motion. We express no opinion on the
ultimate resolution of the motion to reopen on remand.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded for further
proceedings and the entry of a new decision.
