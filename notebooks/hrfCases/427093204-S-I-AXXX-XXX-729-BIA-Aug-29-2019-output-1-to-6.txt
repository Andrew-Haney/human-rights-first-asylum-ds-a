In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Usman B. Ahmad, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Phillip Underwood
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, has filed an appeal from the Immigration
Judge's decision denying the respondent's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. See sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. GS 1208.16 - 1208.18.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a motion for summary affirmance. The
record will be remanded.

We review the Immigration Judge's findings of fact in this matter for clear error. Questions
of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues are reviewed de novo. See 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
The respondent's claims are based on allegations of harm he experienced in Bangladesh after
his father disappeared from the family home. The Immigration Judge made an adverse credibility
finding in this matter (IJ at 4). The Immigration Judge provided two reasons for the credibility
finding. First, the respondent told immigration officers at the border that he was 17 years old (IJ
at 2-3). Second, the respondent testified about two events that were not described in his asylum
application (IJ at 3-4).
The Immigration Judge's credibility finding is clearly erroneous. The Immigration Judge
found that the respondent testified about events not included in his written asylum application,
including an attack on the respondent's mother and sister (IJ at 3). The record establishes, however,
that the respondent attempted to add information to his asylum application prior to signing it (Tr.
at 29). The respondent started to describe an attack on his mother and sister in which his mother's
arm was broken (Tr. at 29-30). The respondent, however, was stopped by the Immigration Judge.
who said they would “get to all those details" later (Tr. at 30). The Immigration Judge explained
Cite as: S-I-, AXXX XXX 729 (BIA Aug. 29, 2019)
729
that he wanted the respondent to sign his application first, and that this required the respondent to
swear that the contents of the application were true and correct to the best of his knowledge and
belief (Tr. at 30). The respondent did so (Tr. at 30-31). The Immigration Judge then began to
question the respondent without asking whether he wanted to add information to the asylum
application (Tr. at 31).'
Given that the respondent was not permitted to add information to his asylum application
before he signed it, even though he tried to provide additional information, it was improper for the
Immigration Judge to then rely on omissions as a basis for an adverse credibility finding. This is
especially true in light of the respondent's prior explanation that he did not speak English and that
his asylum application was prepared with the assistance of a person in the detention facility who
understood “moderate English” (Tr. at 23-24).
The other reason the Immigration Judge gave for finding the respondent not credible was that
he told immigration officials at the border that he was 17 years old and admitted only after several
weeks had passed that he was 22 years old (Tr. at 32, 38). The respondent testified that one of the
many smugglers he encountered told him to say at the border that he was 17 years old (Tr. at 32).
Another smuggler allegedly threatened that the respondent would be held in Mexico for an
extended period of time if his mother did not agree to send money to pay for false documents
showing he was 17 years old (Tr. at 33-38). The respondent testified that his understanding was
that he would be able to get shelter if he said he was 17. and that he had travelled from Bangladesh
because he needed shelter (Tr. at 39).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an asylum seeker's false
statements or use of a false identify document to enter the United States or another country, without
more, is not a proper basis for finding the individual not credible.” Kaur v. Ashcrofi, 379 F.3d 876,
889 (9th Cir. 2004), superseded by statule on other grounds as recognized by Singh v. Holder, 602
F.3d 982, 986 (9th Cir. 2010); see also Akinmade v. INS, 196 F.3d 951, 956 (9th Cir. 1999)
(citations omitted) (distinguishing between “false statements made to establish the critical
elements of the asylum claim from false statements made to evade INS officials”). Although the
Immigration and Nationality Act as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, permits credibility
findings to be based on statements that do not go to the heart of the asylum applicant's claim,
credibility findings must also be based on the totality of the circumstances. See section
208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act. The respondent's statement at the border as to his age, without more,
is not sufficient to support the adverse credibility finding here.

Accordingly, we turn to the Immigration Judge's altemative findings that the respondent did
not qualify for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against
Torture, even if credible.
The respondent testified that he was not involved in politics but that his father was a member
of the Liberal Democratic Party, which was opposed to the ruling Awami League (Tr. at 24, 27-
1
The respondent also requested a continuance to find an attomey, but his motion was denied (Tr.
at 20).

729
28, 41-43). The respondent testified that in October 2017, his father gave a speech against the
Awami League and that he subsequently was in a confrontation with Awami Lcague members and
was injured (Tr. at 41-43). A few days after the incident, the respondent was approached by two
men in the street (Tr. at 43-44). They asked about the respondent's father, and the respondent said
his father was at the family home (Tr. at 43). The respondent told his father about the men and
later that night, the respondent's father disappeared from the home (Tr. at 43-44). At the time of
the hearing. the father was still missing (Tr. at 43-44).
The respondent described a number of events that occurred after his father's disappearance.
The respondent was attacked in November 2017 by men riding motorcycles and was injured and
rendered unconscious (Tr. at 28, 44-46). He required stitches for his injuries (Tr. at 46). Twice in
December 2017, people came to the family home and yelled curses at the family (Tr. at 49-50). In
January 2018, the respondent's mother and sister were attacked while on a rickshaw and the
respondent's mother had her arm broken (Tr. at 46-47). In April 2018, between five and seven
armed individuals were outside cursing at the family's house and the respondent, who has a hearing
limitation, went outside because he did not know anyone was there (Tr. at 50). When he went
outside, he was asked about his father's whereabouts and was beaten (Tr. at 28, 50). His mother
came outside and the people cursed at her and said that when they came the next time, the family
would have to provide information about the respondent's father or the respondent would be killed
(Tr. at 50). The respondent testified that he remained in bed for a week because of the injuries he
suffered during the incident and that he was in significant pain (Tr. at 51-52).
Contrary to the conclusion of the Immigration Judge, the past harm suffered by the respondent
did rise to the level of persecution. In one incident, the respondent was beaten unconscious and
required stitches for his wounds. In another incident, the respondent was beaten badly enough that
he had to remain in bed for a week. The same people who beat him the second time also said they
would kill him. Additionally, the respondent was in his house on two occasions when people came
to the house and shouted curses at the family. The Ninth Circuit has held that physical violence
ordinarily meets the requirement of severity that characterizes persecution as opposed to mere
discrimination. See Hoxha v. Ashcrofi, 319 F.3d 1179, 1182 n.5 (9th Cir. 2003). The Ninth Circuit
has also held that death threats accompanied by “close confrontation" can rise to the level of
persecution, even without physical mistreatment. See, e.g., Ruano v. Ashcrofi, 301 F.3d 1155, 1158
(9th Cir. 2002)(finding past persecution where individual received death threats and was cornered
by armed men on several occasions). Here, there was significant physical violence and also a
death threat.

We tum next to the issue of nexus. There is no clear error in the Immigration Judge's finding
that the harm the respondent suffered in the past and that he fears in the future was not related to
his political opinion or his imputed political opinion (IJ at 6). See Malter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec.
316, 343 (A.G. 2018) (affirming that motivation of the persecutor is a classic factual question).
Although the respondent's asylum application had a box checked showing his claim was based on
“political opinion," the respondent testified that his problems were related to his relationship with
his father. As the Immigration Judge correctly observed, there are any number of reasons why the
individuals who attacked and threatened the family might be interested in the respondent's father
(IJ at 6). Politics is only one of the possible reasons (IJ at 6). Furthermore, there was no evidence
presented that anyone imputed a political opinion to the respondent.

The Immigration Judge stated that it appeared the people who attacked the respondent in April
2018 took out their anger on the respondent when they could not find his father (Tr. at 62).
Notwithstanding that conclusion, the Immigration Judge did not ask the unrepresented respondent
whether he had a family-based claim. Nor did the Immigration Judge analyze whether the
respondent's harm was on account of his family membership or whether that family membership
constituted a protected ground. See Barajas- Romero, 846 F.3d 351 (9th Cir. 2017) (explaining
that for withholding of removal, the applicant must show that a reason for the harm is a protected
ground); Maller of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 208, 212 (BIA 2007) (explaining that a protected
ground such as membership in a particular social group must be at least one central reason for the
persecutor's treatment of the asylum applicant). Nor was the record developed on this point.?
The record was also insufficiently developed on the issue of the government's ability or
willingness to control the people who harmed the respondent (IJ at 7). Furthermore, the
Immigration Judge did not explain the evidentiary basis for his finding that the respondent would
have been unable to leave the country through an international airport if the people who are looking
for his father were being directed by the government (IJ at 7).'
Insofar as the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent could relocate to avoid future
harm, the record shows that the respondent attempted to relocate internally. The respondent
described trying to relocate, and he said he was warned about going outside since people are not
used to newcomers and start to ask questions if they see someone they don't know (Tr. at 47-48).
The respondent also said that he tried to stay with a cousin and her husband, but the husband did
not want him because the couple was having a hard time financially (Tr. at 48). Ultimately, the
burden of proof on the issue of interal relocation depends on whether the respondent establishes
past persecution on account of a protected ground. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(6)(1)(ii). Thus, the
intemal relocation issue should be revisited on remand.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Under the circumstances, we will remand the record for further proceedings in which to
develop the record and to consider the nexus between the respondent's past harm, which rose to
the level of persecution, and his family relationship to his father; whether that relationship stems
from a cognizable particular social group; and also whether the government is unwilling or unable
to control the people the respondent fears. See Rios v. Lynch, 807 F.3d 1123 (9th Cir. 2015);
Maller of L-E-A., 271&N Dec. 581 (A.G. 2019). The Immigration Judge should also again address
the issue of interal relocation.

In concluding that the record was not sufficiently developed, we note that the unrepresented
respondent was not asked whether he had anything to add to his testimony after the Immigration
Judge and the attorney for the DHS asked their questions.
3 At the hearing, the Immigration Judge advised the respondent that the government did not seem
to be tracking him or hunting him (Tr. at 63). However, whether or not the goverment is hunting
the respondent is not necessarily connected to whether the goverment is unwilling or unable to
control the people the respondent fears.
