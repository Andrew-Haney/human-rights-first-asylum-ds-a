IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Luis A. Colon Perez, Esquire!
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Jennifer Riester
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal
The respondent, a native and citizen of South Korea and lawful permanent resident of the
United States, appeals from the Immigration Judge's June 21, 2019, decision pretermitting her
application for withholding of removal.? Section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). The Department of Homeland Security filed a motion for summary
affirmance. The record will be remanded.

We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The sole issue on appeal is whether the Immigration Judge erted by pretermitting the
respondent's application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The
Immigration Judge found that the respondent is removable under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii)
and, without additional fact finding or legal analysis, that as a result of her conviction for an
aggravated felony she is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal (IJ at 6). While an
aggravated felony conviction renders the respondent per se ineligible for asylum, it does not
necessarily render her ineligible for withholding of removal. Compare sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii)
an (B)(i) of the Act (providing that for the purposes of asylum, an aggravated felony is per se a
particularly serious crime), with section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act (providing that an alien who has
The respondent is represented before the Board, as she was before the Immigration Judge, by a
Qualified Representative. We note that the respondent submitted documents to the Board pro se.
Given our disposition of the respondent's appeal, we need not determine if these documents were
properly filed or, if so, they would constitute new evidence warranting remand.
2 The respondent has not challenged on appeal the Immigration Judge's denial of her application
for protection under the Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. S$ 1208.16(c), 1208.17, 1208.18.
We therefore deem this issue waived. See e.g., Maller of J-G-P-, 27 I&N Dec. 642, 651 n. 1
(BIA 2019).

been convicted of a particularly serious crime is ineligible for withholding of removal and that an
alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony for which she has been sentenced to an
aggregate term of imprisonment of at least 5 years shall be considered to have committed a
particularly serious crime).
Because the respondent was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years, her
aggravated felony conviction does not render her per se ineligible for withholding of removal.
Accordingly, further consideration of the respondent's conviction is required in order to determine
whether it was for a particularly serious crime. See Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336 (BIA 2007)
(generally, where a conviction is not for an aggravated felony for which the alien has been
sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least 5 years, to determine whether an offense
was a particularly serious crime, we consider a variety of factors, including the nature of the
conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and the circumstances and underlying facts of the
conviction.); see also Hakim v. Holder, 628 F.3d 151, 155 (5th Cir. 2010) (finding that the Board
applied the correct legal standard “because the B[oard's]opinion clearly indicates that it performed
a case-specific analysis of (an alien)'s claim consistent with precedent).
We will therefore remand the record to the Immigration Judge to make factual findings and
engage in legal analysis with respect to whether the respondent has been convicted of a particularly
serious crime and, if not, to further consider the respondent's application for withholding of
removal.
