IN ASYLUM AND/OR WITHHOLDING PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Efthimia Barbagiannis, Esquire
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The applicant, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed from an Immigration Judge's
February 1, 2019, decision denying his applications for withholding of removal pursuant to section
241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and protection under the
Convention Against Torture. The Department of Homeland Security has not filed a response to
the applicant's appeal. The record will be remanded.
This Board must defer to the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including findings as to the
credibility of testimony, unless they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
questions of law, discretion, and judgment de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(2)(3)(ii).

The applicant alleges on appeal that his former attomey, Mr. Jan Mahmood Tamoor, provided
ineffective assistance because he failed to adequately prepare the case, did not conduct a proper
legal and factual inquiry, and failed to articulate all of the particular social groups of which the
applicant is a member. In addition, the applicant states that the Immigration Judge denied his
request to have witnesses testify because the attomey did not prepare the witness list in accordance
with the Uniform Rules of Immigration Court Practice. He further argues the attomey's deficient
performance prejudiced the outcome of the removal proceedings by depriving him of the
opportunity to present direct witness testimony in support of his claim and by foreclosing a viable
legal claim.
We conclude that the applicant has substantially complied with the procedural requirements to
make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA
1988), aff'd sub nom. Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988), and the facts on which the
ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based are clear on the face of the record. Yang v.
Gonzales, 478 F.3d 133, 143 (2d Cir. 2007). In addition, we conclude that the applicant has shown
prejudice such that a remand for a new hearing is warranted. Specifically, one of the reasons the
Immigration Judge precluded the testimony of the applicant's witnesses was because Mr. Tamoor
failed to comply with the Uniform Rules of Immigration Court Practice by not providing before
the hearing the alien registration numbers of his proposed witnesses and a written summary of
their testimony (IJ at 2; Tr. at 30).
Further, during the hearing Mr. Tamoor initially stated that he did not have information about
which statutory grounds for withholding of removal the applicant is relying upon (Tr. at 29-30).
Later, the attomey had difficulty articulating a specific particular social group. First he stated that
Cite as: H-G-P-H-, AXXX XXX 178 (BIA July 9, 2019)
-178
the applicant's particular social group is “a young man who is being sought out for recruiting by
the gangs and he is a young man who said no. So he's a young man who's be – who was sought
out for being a base, vigilant recruit, he has no tattoos” (Tr. at 31). He clarified that the applicant
is a member of a group of "young males with no gang affiliations” (Tr. at 32). When the
Immigration Judge asked what Board precedent supports such a particular social group, he cited a
case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, even though this case arises in
the Second Circuit, and was unable to cite any Board precedent (Tr. at 32-33). Further, Mr.
Tamoor admitted in a statement sent to the applicant's attomey that his performance was deficient
because he did not distinguish the applicant's particular social group from Matter of M-E-V-G-,
26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014), and Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 579 (BIA 2008), and he did not
articulate the potentially viable claim that the applicant was persecuted on account of his
membership in a particular social group of “members of the Pineda-Hernandez family”
(Applicant's Brief at Attachments C, D).
Thus, we conclude that the applicant's prior attorney provided ineffective assistance, and we
will remand the proceedings for a new hearing and for the entry of a new decision containing
sufficient factual and legal analysis that is adequate for our appellate review. See Master of S-H-,
23 I&N Dec. 462, 465 (BIA 2002) (noting the Board's limited fact-finding authority and the need
for Immigration Judges to include clear and complete findings of fact in their decisions). As such,
we need not address the applicant's remaining arguments on appeal. On remand, the parties may
present new evidence and arguments relevant to the applicant's request for relief and regarding
any other relief for which he may be eligible.

Accordingly, the following order is entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion
and for the entry of a new decision.
