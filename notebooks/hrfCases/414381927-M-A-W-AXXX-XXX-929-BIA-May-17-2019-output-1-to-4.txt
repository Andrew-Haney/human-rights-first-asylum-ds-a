In re: M
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Mariana L. Hanna, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Alexandra R. Tinkham
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appeals from an Immigration Judge's
September 18, 2017, decision granting the respondent's application for asylum under section
208(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). The appeal will
be dismissed, and the record will be remanded for the completion or updating of any required
background and security checks.

We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including determinations of
credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues de novo,
including questions of law, judgment, discretion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On appeal, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge erred in granting the respondent's
application for asylum. Specifically, the DHS disputes the Immigration Judge's finding that the
respondent, a native and citizen of Somalia, established a well-founded fear of persecution based
on his political opinion or membership in a particular social group (DHS’s Br. at 9-14).
At the hearing below, the respondent testified, credibly (IJ at 8),' that he is a member of the
Ashraf clan, which is a minority group in Somalia that comprises less than 5% of the population
(IJ at 2; Tr. at 62). The respondent further testified that he, his father, brother, and brother-in-law,
all worked at a car service shop in Somalia, which primarily worked on government and military
vehicles (IJ at 3; Tr. at 70-71). He stated that the shop owners received a letter in 2010 from a
terrorist
group known as Al Shabaab, which opposes the Somalian government, threatening to kill
everyone in the shop if the business did not shut down (IJ at 3-4; Tr. at 68, 72). The respondent
further stated that because the owners did not take the threat seriously, the shop was attacked in
2011 and again in 2012, by members of the Al Shabaab (IJ at 3-4; Tr. at 73-74). The respondent
testified that in September of 2014, his brother and brother-in-law were killed by the Al Shabab
while they were working in the shop (IJ at 4; Tr. at 76-78). Additionally, because the respondent's
father spoke out against Al Shabaab to people in the community, he, too, was murdered on

otherwise dispute the respondent's credibility on appeal.

September 20, 2014, by members of the Al Shabaab (IJ at 5; Tr. at 83-85). The respondent also
stated that after his father's killing, he was threatened with death by the Al Shabaab if he did not
stop working at the shop (IJ at 5; Tr. at 91-92, 95).
Upon our de novo review, we affinn the Immigration Judge's determination that the
respondent has established a well-founded fear of persecution based on his imputed political
opinion (IJ at 9-11). See section 208(b)(1)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(3)(i) (explaining
that where an applicant has not established cognizable past persecution, he bears the burden
of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that it would not be reasonable for
him to intemally relocate); see Matter of Z-2-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586, 591-92 (BIA 2015); Matter
of D-1-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448, 450 (BIA 2008); see also Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526, 532
(BIA 2011) (stating that the motive of a persecutor is a finding of fact to be determined by the
Immigration Judge and reviewed for clear error). Specifically, the Immigration Judge correctly
found that the respondent's credible testimony demonstrated that he has a subjectively and
objectively reasonable fear of persecution based on his imputed political opinion in support of the
Somalian government and against the Al Shabaab (IJ at 10). See Castillo-Gutierrez v. Lynch,
809 F.3d 449, 452 (8th Cir. 2016) (explaining that “[a] fear of future persecution is ‘well founded'
if it ‘is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable”') (internal citation omitted);
Perinpanathan v. INS, 310 F.3d 594, 598 (8th Cir. 2002) (stating that “[flor an alien's fear of
persecution to be objectively reasonable, the fear must have basis in reality and must be neither
irrational nor so speculative or general as to lack credibility”) (citation omitted). The Immigration
Judge noted that the respondent's brother and brother-in-law were killed by the Al Shabaab while
working at the car service garage because Al Shabaab viewed them as supporters of the
govemment and anti-Islamic (IJ at 10-11). Significantly, the Immigration Judge noted that reports
on country conditions in Somalia show that civilian killings, which are primarily caused by
Al Shabaab, continue to persist (IJ at 11).

Contrary to the DHS's appellate arguments, we affirm the Immigration Judge's finding that
the respondent has demonstrated that the harm he fears in Somalia was or would be inflicted by
the goverment or by individuals or groups that the government is unable or unwilling to control
(IJ at 11; DHS's Br. at 9-10). See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 337-38, 343-44 (A.G. 2018);
see also Saldana v. Lynch, 820 F.3d 970, 976 (8th Cir. 2016) (explaining that “to establish
persecution based on the conduct of private actors, an applicant must show that the govemment
either condones the conduct or is unable to protect the victims” and that whether a goverment is
unable to control a private actor is a factual question). There is no clear error in the Immigration
Judge's finding based on evidence of country conditions that the Somalian government has been
generally ineffective in protecting its citizens and controlling the Al Shabaab (IJ at 11). On appeal,
the DHS does not dispute the country conditions evidence relied upon by the Immigration Judge;
instead, it points to other evidence in the record which reflects that Somalia has recently made
efforts, in conjunction with interational partners, to eradicate the Al Shabaab (DHS’s Br. at 9-10;
see Exh. 5). As the Immigration Judge's decision and the State Department reports make clear,
however, the Al Shabaab continues to operate throughout Somalia, and as the respondent testified
credibly, the group targets individuals who it perceives to support the Somalian government and
to be against them (IJ at 6; Tr. at 102-03). Cf. Saldana v. Lynch, 820 F.3d at 977 (“Instability to
control private actors is an imprecise concept that leaves room for discretion by the agency."); see
also Gathungu v. Holder, 725 F.3d 900, 909 (8th Cir. 2013)(citing Sarhan v. Holder, 658 F.3d
649, 660 (7th Cir. 2011) (“Attempted refonn, like a bill that fails to become law, does not count
as concrete government action.”).

We are also not persuaded by the DHS's appellate argument that the respondent can safely
retum to his hometown of Mogadishu based on its claim “that the government of Somalia is in
control of the respondent's hometown” (DHS’s Br. at 13), to the extent that the DHS has not cited
to record evidence to support its argument.
Consequently, in light of the foregoing, we affirm the Immigration Judge's determination that
the respondent is eligible for asylum as he has established a well-founded fear of persecution on
account of a protected ground under the Act(IJ at 9-12). See section 208(b)(1)(A) of the Act.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the DHS the opportunity to complete or update
identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations, and further proceedings, if
necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(h).

In light of our decision, we find it unnecessary to address any additional issues raised by the
parties on appeal. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 170 (BIA 2013) (stating that, as a general
rule, courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is
unnecessary to the results they reach) (citing INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976)).
