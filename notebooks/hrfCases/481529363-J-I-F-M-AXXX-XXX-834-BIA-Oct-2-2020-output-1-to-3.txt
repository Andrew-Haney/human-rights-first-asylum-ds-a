IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Matthew L. Hoppock, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Ian Tomasic
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
March 26, 2018, decision denying his applications for asylum under section 208 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $ 1158, and withholding of removal under section
241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded.

We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N
Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues
de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge denied asylum and withholding of removal after rejecting the
respondent's three proposed particular social groups. A particular social group must be composed
of members who share a common immutable characteristic that is defined with particularity and is
socially distinct within the society in question. Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014),
vacated in part on other grounds, Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016). The respondent
proposed the following three groups: 1) former Guatemalan business owners, 2) former
Guatemalan business owners who resist drug traffickers, and 3) former Guatemalan business
owners who make police reports against drug traffickers.
Upon careful consideration, we conclude that the Immigration Judge's decision does not
contain sufficient fact finding and analysis regarding these proposed groups and whether the
respondent was harmed on account of his membership in this group (IJ at 10-12; Respondent's Br.
at 6-8). See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 465 (BIA 2002). “The resolution of such issues
is ... inherently factual in nature.” Matter of W-Y-C- & H-O-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 189, 191 (BIA
2018) (citations omitted). “While we review the ultimate determination whether a proposed group
is cognizable de novo, we review an Immigration Judge's factual findings underlying that

The respondent on appeal has not meaningfully addressed the Immigration Judge's denial of
protection under the Convention Against Torture, and that claim is waived on appeal. See Matter
of Z-Z-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586, 586 n.1 (BIA 2015).

determination for clear error.” Id. The Immigration Judge's decision does not contain sufficient
fact finding for us to conduct our appellate review.
Although we are remanding the record, we reject two due process arguments from the
respondent that lack merit. He first argues that the Immigration Judge erred by requiring written
pleadings (Respondent's Br. at 9). Even assuming that this requirement constituted error, we
discern no prejudice. See Tun v. Gonzales, 485 F.3d 1014, 1026 (8th Cir. 2007) (“To be entitled
to relief based on an alleged due process violation, a petitioner under the immigration laws must
show prejudice.”). “In this context, prejudice means a showing that the outcome of the proceeding
may well have been different had there not been any procedural irregularities." Id. (citation
omitted). The respondent has not shown that the factual allegations are incorrect or that he is not
inadmissible as charged.
Second, he argues that the transcript contains numerous errors. We are not convinced that he
was prejudiced in this context as well. The respondent notes four examples. The first involves a
statement from the Immigration Judge regarding written pleadings (Tr. at 8). This indiscernible
statement is not material, as it is uncontested that pleadings were written. Additionally, we have
found no prejudice from the Immigration Judge using this format for pleadings. Second, a
comment about one of the respondent's exhibits by the Immigration Judge is indiscernible
(Tr. at 43). This exhibit was not timely filed (Tr. at 42-43). This indiscernible is not prejudicial,
as the record reflects that the Immigration Judge admitted that exhibit.

The respondent points to two untranslated portions of his testimony regarding the name of his
elementary school and the name of his business (Tr. at 27, 31). We are not convinced that the
absence of an elementary school name prejudiced the respondent's case, given that the
respondent's case is about his adult life. The respondent's business name was properly translated
later and is acknowledged in the Immigration Judge's decision (IJ at 3; Tr. at 32).
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision and for
the entry of a new decision.
