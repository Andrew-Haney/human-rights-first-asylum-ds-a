IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Barry R. Goldberg, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening; termination
The respondent has been lawfully in the United States under the Immigration Judge's grant of
withholding of removal to Guinea since the Board's July 26, 2012, final administrative decision.
The respondent has now filed a motion to reopen and terminate the proceedings to apply for
adjustment of status with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). The
USCIS recently approved a marriage-based visa petition (Form I-130) filed on the respondent's
behalf by her United States citizen husband. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has
not opposed the motion. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(g)(3). Given the lack of DHS opposition, the
respondent's lawful status in the United States, and the other evidence presented, we will
sua sponte grant the respondent's motion to reopen and terminate the proceedings. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.2(a); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Accordingly, the following order
is entered.

ORDER: The motion is granted, and the proceedings are terminated without prejudice.
