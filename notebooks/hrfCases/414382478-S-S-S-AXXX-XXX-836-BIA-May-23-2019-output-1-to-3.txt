IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
Motion
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Eman H. Jajonie Daman, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Robert Melching
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondent is a native and citizen of Iraq. On March 21, 2014, this Board dismissed his
appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision denying his application for deferral of removal
under the Convention Against Torture. On August 11, 2017, the Board denied the respondents
first motion to reopen proceedings. On September 11, 2017, the respondent filed a second motion
to reopen. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appears to have filed an opposition to
the motion, but the Board's attempts to obtain a copy of the opposition from the DHS have been
unsuccessful.' The respondents motion to reopen will be granted and the record will be remanded.

With certain exc ons, an alien is entitled to file only one motion to reopen and that motion
must be filed not later than 90 days after the final administrative order. See section 240(c)(7) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). There is an
exception, however, to the filing requirements for motions to reopen that seek to apply or reapply
for asylum or withholding based on changed country conditions or circumstances. See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (providing an exception for motions that are to apply for asylum or withholding
based on changed circumstances arising in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if
the respondent presents evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been
discovered or presented at the previous hearing); see also section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act.
Motions to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture fall within this exception.

The respondent asserts that his present motion is based on changed conditions in Iraq since his
last hearing, which was in 2013. The respondent also claims that his prior motion to reopen was
filed by an attorney who provided ineffective assistance of counsel. In this regard, the respondent
has set out a claim against his former attorney, James Hoare, and has complied with the procedural
requirements for ineffective assistance of counsel claims as established in Matter of Lozada, 19
I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).

'The Board does have the respondent's reply to the DHS's opposition, as well as the DHS’s
“Response to Amici Brief,” and the “Brief on Behalf of Amici Curiae in Support of the
Respondent.”

We first address the claim of changed conditions in Iraq. The respondent has submitted
evidence indicating that conditions for persons similarly situated to him have changed in Iraq since
the last hearing in this matter. The evidence includes the declaration of Daniel W. Smith, a
researcher specializing in Iraq who lives in that country. Smith explains that he has conducted
interviews with more than 100 torture victims in Iraq, has “firsthand observation of arrest,
interrogation and torture by Iraqi security forces” and has reviewed “reports of official use of
torture” (Mot. Attach. at 47). Other declarations, media articles, and country conditions reports
have also been included with the motion. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence of changed
conditions that are material to the respondent's application for protection under the Convention
Against Torture to support granting the motion to reopen.
Separately, we conclude that the respondent has established ineffective assistance of counsel
by James Hoare. The respondent has submitted documentation showing that the attomey aided a
non-lawyer in the unauthorized practice of law and that this non-lawyer held himself out as an
attorney and prepared the respondent's first motion to reopen (Mot. Attach. 1-37). The motion
vas signed by Hoare and filed under his name. The motion was not accompanied by actual
evidence, and a supplemental filing did not include evidence that supported the respondent's claim.
Furthermore, the respondent alleges that the motion was plagiarized and that the respondent was
charged for a fictitious filing fee (Mot. at 26).? Given the respondent's evidence, we conclude that
he has established ineffective assistance of counsel that prejudiced him in his attempt to seek
reopening. See Allabani v. Gonzales, 402 F.3d 668 (6th Cir. 2005).
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.

FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion.
