In re: G
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Suzanne L. Capriotti, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Nicole K. Barmore
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed the February 1, 2017,
decision of the Immigration Judge denying her applications for asylum and withholding of removal
under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158 and
1231(b)(3), and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.16 - 1208.18. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed a reply opposing
the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed in part and the record will be remanded.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the "clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. ſ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judgc's findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. We aſfirm and adopt the
Immigration Judge's decision regarding asylum and withholding of removal. See Matter of
Burbano, 20 I&N Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). In particular, the respondent did not establish past
persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground (IJ at 1-
9; Tr. at 8-38; Exh. 7). Contrary to the respondent's appellate contention (Respondent's Br. at 7-
9), flight from gang recruitment is not a protected ground under the Act. See Zelaya v. Holder,
668 F.3d 159, 166-67 (4th Cir. 2012); Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 579, 589 (BIA 2008). The
respondent's reliance upon Martinez v. Holder, 740 F.3d 902 (4th Cir. 2014), as revised (Jan. 27,
2014), (Respondent's Br. at 9) is misplaced as that case is factually distinguishable, insofar as the
respondent is not a former gang member. In particular, in Martinez v. Holder, the Fourth Circuit
determined that the alien's membership in a group consisting of former members of a gang in
El Salvador was an immutable characteristic to determine whether the group qualified as a
particular social group. Consequently, we will dismiss the respondent's appeal of the Immigration
Judge's denial of asylum and withholding of removal.
Regarding protection under the Convention Against Torture, the respondent maintains that the
Immigration Judge failed to consider all the record evidence (Respondent's Br. at 15), and only
referenced that the respondent made no effort to contact law enforcement (IJ at 9). An Immigration
Judge's decision that lacks sufficient analysis does not provide an adequate opportunity to the alien

to contest the Immigration Judge's determinations on appeal and leaves the Board without
adequate means of reviewing the bases for the Immigration Judge's decision in light of the
respondent's arguments on appeal. See Matter of A- P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468 (BIA 1999); Matter of
M-P-, 20 I&N Dec. 786 (BIA 1994) (finding that an Immigration Judge must fully explain the
reasons for denying a motion in order to allow the respondent a fair opportunity to contest the
decision and the Board an opportunity for meaningful appellate review). The United States Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case lies, has recently emphasized this
point, joining other circuits in insisting that Immigration Judges and the Board must aggregate the
risks of torture in adjudicating claims under the Convention Against Torture. See Rodriguez-Arias
v. Whitaker, 915 F.3d 968 (4th Cir. 2019) (noting that an Immigration Judge should consider all
evidence relevant to the possibility of future harm in assessing whether it is more likely than not
that torture would occur). See also Cabrera-Vasquez v. Barr, 919 F.3d 218 (4th Cir. 2019);
8 C.F.R. § 1208.16 (c)(3).
Here, the respondent advanced testimony relevant to her fear of rape and to news reports
concerning collusion among police and gangs. The Immigration Judge did not evaluate these in
his analysis of the respondent's claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
Because the Board may not engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding appeals (See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv)), we find remand appropriate here for further fact-finding. On remand, the
Immigration Judge may receive any additional evidence he deems appropriate to the full resolution
of this matter. While we conclude that remanded proceedings are warranted, we express no
opinion regarding the ultimate outcome of these proceedings at the present time. See Matter of
L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996).

Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal of the Immigration Judge's denial of asylum and
withholding of removal is dismissed.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision regarding protection
under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16 - 1208.18.
FOR THE BOARD
Board Member Hugh G. Mullane would also affirm the Immigration Judge's denial of
protection under the Convention Against Torture and so dissents without further opinion
from that portion of the majority's decision.
