IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Smaranda Draghia, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Ross Kurtz
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, has appealed the Immigration Judge's
May 10, 2019, decision denying her' applications for asylum and withholding of removal under
sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
$$ 1158(b)(1)(A) and 1231(b)(3)(A), as well as her request for protection under the Convention
Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The Department of Homeland Security
(“DHS”) has filed a request for summary affirmance. The appeal will be sustained in part and
dismissed in part.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On appeal, the respondent claims past and future persecution in Mexico on account of her
membership in the particular social group, “Mexican transgender women” (IJ at 9). The
Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was statutorily barred from asylum as a result
of the 1-year filing deadline (IJ at 7). The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent's
application for withholding of removal and request for protection under the Convention Against
Torture based on a determination that the respondent did not meet her burden of proof to establish
eligibility (IJ at 7-11).
We uphold the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent was statutorily barred
from applying for asylum because shc did not file for asylum within 1 year of her arrival, and did
not provide to the satisfaction of the Immigration Judge that an exception applied
(1J at 7). See sections 208(a)(2)(B) and (D) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(a)(2)(B), (D);
8 C.F.R. § 1208.4. The respondent arrived in the United States in 2007 and filed her asylum

female pronouns.

-308
application in the spring of 2019 (IJ at 7; Exhs. 1 and 2). The respondent generally claimed that
she did not know she could file for asylum after entering illegally, but did not specifically provide
any other explanation of why she waited over 12 years to file for asylum. Her generalized reason
for not filing a timely asylum application is insufficient to prove that an exception applied.
On appeal, the respondent argues that she meets an exception to the 1-year filing deadline
based on the existence of extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing. Sections
208(a)(2)(B), (D) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. $ 1208.4(a)(5). The respondent argues that she experienced
numerous traumatic experiences after she entered the United States, including abuse at the hands
of companions, an HIV diagnosis, depression and drug use (Respondent's Br. at 8-10). These
arguments were not, however, presented to the Immigration Judge.
The Immigration Judge did consider the respondent's HIV diagnosis, and whether that
diagnosis was an exception (IJ at 7). 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.4(a)(4)(ii) and 1208.4(a)(5). The
respondent was diagnosed in 2013, but the respondent did not file her asylum application until
2019, long after her HIV diagnosis. The respondent did not specifically testify that mental health
issues prevented her from filing a timely asylum application, or from filing one within a reasonable
time after her HIV diagnosis. Contrary to counsel's argument on appeal, the respondent did not
testify that a real or perceived sense of isolation or her abusive relationship prevented her from
filing an asylum application.
We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that, based on the evidentiary record, the
respondent does not warrant an exception to the filing deadline. Thus, the respondent has not
established that she warrants an exception to the 1-year filing deadline for asylum. The respondent
remains eligible to apply for withholding of removal under the Act and protection under the
Convention Against Torture.

The Immigration Judge found that the respondent credibly testified (IJ at 5-6). During early
adolescence, the respondent was physically and mentally abused by her father because he
perceived her as feminine and because she intervened on behalf of her mother, who was also
abused (IJ at 7-8; Tr. at 40-44). The respondent met someone on the intemet and eventually
traveled to the United States and entered illegally. In the United States, the respondent was
involved in a series of relationships, most of which involved abuse, and all of which ended.
The Immigration Judge accepted that the respondent was a member of a cognizable particular
social group involving Mexican transgender women, but denied relief because the harm to the
respondent involved domestic violence in her family of origin. See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec.
316, 320 (A.G. 2018) (as a general matter, domestic violence claims by“nongovernmental actors
will not qualify for asylum.").
On appeal, the respondent argues that she proved that one central reason for the harm she
suffered was her gender identity. We agree. The evidence indicates that the father had mixed
motives for the harm he inflicted. See Gonzales-Veliz v. Barr, 938 F.3d 219, 224 (5th Cir. 2019).
The respondent testified that she was beaten because she was feminine, in addition to the domestic
violence inflicted on her mother and siblings. Her credible testimony established that one central
2

308
reason she was targeted was because of her gender identity (Tr. at 40-45). She has therefore shown
that she suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground.
Given the Immigration Judge's resolution of the issues in this case, the Immigration Judge did
not consider whether the government was unable and unwilling to protect the respondent in the
past. We will therefore remand this proceeding for consideration of whether the Mexican
government has the willingness and ability to protect her, which must be decided before
determining whether a presumption of future harm exists, as well as whether the respondent or the
DHS has the burden of proving a future threat to life or freedom. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1) and
(2).
We also agree with the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent did not meet
her burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that she will be subject to torture upon
removal to Mexico (IJ at 10-11). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2). To qualify for protection under
the Convention Against Torture, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he or
she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal by or at the instigation of or
with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1). Acquiescence “requires that the public official, prior to the activity
constituting torture, have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal
responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(7); see also
Morales v. Sessions, 860 F.3d 812, 818 (5th Cir. 2017).
The Immigration Judge found that government officials had not tortured the respondent or
acquiesced in her torture, in the past, and has not shown that she would be tortured in the future
(IJ at 11). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(3) (stating that in assessing whether it is more likely than not
that an alien would be tortured in the proposed country of removal, all evidence relevant to the
possibility of future torture must be considered, including evidence of past torture). We find no
basis for disturbing these findings.

Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is dismissed with respect to the Immigration Judge's denial of the
respondent's application for asylum as untimely and for protection under the Convention Against
Torture.
FURTHER ORDER: The appeal is sustained with respect to the Immigration Judge's denial
of the respondent's application for withholding of removal.

The respondent also requested asylum and withholding on account of religion, as well as her
membership in a particular social group of Mexican people perceived as gay. There was
insufficient testimony presented as to harm related to her religion, and the Immigration Judge
found that the respondent did not present sufficient evidence that she was a member of the group
of Mexican people perceived as gay ([J at 8-9). On appeal, the respondent does not pursue either
of these issues.
