In re: Y
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
Thomas J. Tarigo, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Joshua S. Levy
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum, withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of China, has filed a timely appeal of an
Immigration Judge's April 3, 2018, decision, denying her applications for asylum and withholding
of removal under sections 208(a) and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
$$ 1158(a) and 1231(b)(3); as well as denying her request for protection from removal under the
Convention Against Torture, for failure to meet her burden of proof. The appeal will be sustained.

The Board reviews an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including findings as to the
credibility of testimony, and the likelihood of future events, under the “clearly
erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-2-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA
2015). The Board reviews questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in an appeal
from an Immigration Judge's decision de novo. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge found the respondent to be generally credible (IJ at 5), and
determined that the respondent had established past persecution based on the incidents described
(i.e., the two forcible abortions conducted by the Chinese Family Planning officials pursuant to
China's coercive family planning policies) (IJ at 6). A finding of past persecution creates a
rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution (IJ at 6-7). See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). Nonetheless, even assuming the respondent does not have an objective
basis to fear future persecution due to enforcement of China's coercive family planning policies
on account of the speculative conclusions cited by the Immigration Judge (e.g., the respondent is
now 52-years-old and is no longer of child-bearing age), considering the severity of the past
persecution in this case (i.e., the respondent is the victim of two forcible abortions conducted by
the Chinese Family Planning officials), the respondent has established compelling reasons for
being unwilling to return to her country) (IJ at 7; Respondent's Br. at 6). See Matter of L-S-,
25 I&N Dec. 705, 711-12 (BIA 2012); see also 8 C.F.R. & 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A).
Thus, on de novo review, and considering the severity of the harm (physical, psychological,
and emotional) experienced by the respondent in this case on account of her two forced abortions,
we find the respondent has established compelling reasons for being unwilling to return to her

country, and therefore the respondent has established that she merits a grant of humanitarian
asylum in the exercise of discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A).
Accordingly, the following orders are entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the denial of asylum is vacated, and the respondent is
found eligible for this form of relief.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the DHS the opportunity to complete or update
identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations, and further proceedings,
if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.47(h).
