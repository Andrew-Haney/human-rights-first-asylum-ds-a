APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:
Robert Andrew Painter, Esquire
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The applicant, a native and citizen of Honduras, has appealed from the September 23, 2019,
decision of the Immigration Judge, denying his applications for withholding of removal and
protection under the Convention Against Torture. Section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. Ş 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. SS 1208.16(c), 1208.18(a). The appeal will
be sustained.
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a "clearly erroneous“ standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The Immigration Judge found the applicant to be credible, and that finding is not clearly
erroneous (IJ at 5). 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). With respect to the application for protection under
the Convention Against Torture, the Immigration Judge found that in comparing the murders of
the applicant's brother and cousin to threats against him. the applicant was trying to string together
a series of suppositions without establishing each step in the hypothetical chain of events (IJ at 10-
11). Matter of J-F-F., 23 I&N Dec. 912, 917 (A.G. 2006); see Matter of M-B-A-, 23 I&N Dec.
474, 479-80 (BIA 2002). The Immigration Judge stated that the applicant's belief that “the hand
of law enforcement" took the lives of his two family members is insufficient to demonstrate that
he would be subject to future torture and that authorities would acquiesce to or turn a blind eye to
his torture (IJ at 10-11).
The applicant challenges the Immigration Judge's findings with respect to the likelihood of
torture in connection with the murders of his relatives (Respondent's Br. at 18-25). The applicant
testified to the following: his brother was arrested for a minor traffic infraction (not wearing a
motorcycle helmet); there were five officers at the scene; the officers refused to allow the applicant
to take the valuables in his brother's possession, which included proceeds from a motorcycle sale
and a motorcycle; the applicant was told he could go to the police station the next day for his
brother: early the next morning, the brother's murdered body was found outside of town; the
applicant and his cousin went to the police station to file a complaint against the officers who had
arrested the brother; the applicant gave the names of three officers at the scene and the patrol car
number; the officer on duty told the applicant that what happened to his brother could happen to

the applicant and his family if he made a report; the applicant's cousin disappeared the following
day, and he was later found murdered with his eyes and tongue cut out.
“[A] finding is clearly erroneous' when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing
court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
committed.” Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003). Here, the Immigration Judge's
factual finding that the applicant is not likely to be tortured is clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). When the applicant's credible and uncontradicted testimony is taken as a whole,
the events which included the brother's arrest by numerous officers for a simple traffic infraction;
the confiscation of the brother's valuables; the brother's murdered body found during a time in
which police stated he would be in their custody; violent threats by police to the applicant and
cousin after the applicant indicated he could identify the patrol car and some of the officers; the
disappearance and murder, with eyes and tongue cut out, of the cousin; and the lack of investigation
into the brother's murder clearly are not random and unrelated. See, e.g., Chavarria v. Gonzalez,
446 F.3d 508, 519-20 (3d Cir. 2006) (finding asylum applicant's credible testimony did not point
to random and unrelated events but showed a violent robbery was an attempt to suppress
inforination about an attack, especially in view of the similar methods of attack). The events
indicate the murder of the applicant's brother shortly after being taken into police custody,
followed by threats to and subsequent murder of the respondent's cousin to suppress information
about the first crime. The murder of the applicant's cousin, who had accompanied the applicant
to report the crime but had not been at the scene of the brother's arrest, indicates a likelihood that
the applicant would also face the same fate if returned to Honduras.

Additionally, the applicant has established that the torture would likely be “by or at the
instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an
official capacity." 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1). See Master of O-F-A-S- 27 I&N Dec. 709 (BIA
2019). The applicant's brother was arrested by police officers who were on duty and in their
official uniforms and who used handcuffs to take him away in a patrol car. See id. at 716 (stating
that if a law enforcement officer was on duty and in his official uniform at the time of the torturous
conduct, it is more likely that he acted under color of law”). A police officer at the station
demanded the identification documents of the applicant and cousin and threatened that the same
thing would happen to them if they brought a complaint against the police, which suggests that he
could also be arrested and then murdered. The evidence shows a likelihood that police officers,
who arrested and killed the applicant's brother and likely also killed his cousin, would be involved
in torturing the applicant following his return to Honduras, and the Immigration Judge's finding
to the contrary is clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the applicant has established his eligibility for
withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture.' Thus, the following orders will
be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
I
Because the applicant has been found eligible for protection under the Convention Against
Torture, we will not address his application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(A)
of the Act.

examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.47(h).
