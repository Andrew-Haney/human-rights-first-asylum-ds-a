IN BOND PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Colleen Cowgill, Esquire
APPLICATION: Redetermination of custody status
The respondent appeals from an Immigration Judge's June 26, 2019, decision denying his
request for release, on bond, from the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”).'
The record will be remanded.
The respondent, a native and citizen of Togo, is the subject of an administratively final order
of removal that is pending review before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Despite this final removal order, the respondent remains subject to the Immigration
Judge's custody review authority pursuant to various injunctions issued by the United States
District Court for the Central District of California. See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Holder,
No. CV 07-3239 TJH RNBX, 2013 WL 5229795 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2013), affd in part sub nom.
Rodriguez v. Marin, 909 F.3d 252 (9th Cir. 2018); Hernandez v. Lynch, No. 5:16-cv-00620-JGB-
KK, 2016 WL 7116611 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 10, 2016), aff'd sub nom. Hernandez v. Sessions,
872 F.3d 976, 1000 (9th Cir. 2017). Though the respondent received a custody review hearing
below in accordance with those injunctions, the Immigration Judge ultimately denied his request
for release after finding that he poses a flight risk (IJ Memo at 3).

We discern no error in the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent would pose
a substantial flight risk if released from DHS custody. The Immigration Judge and this Board have
already determined that the respondent is removable and ineligible for all requested relief. As he
is unlikely to be allowed to remain in this country lawfully, he has a strong incentive to abscond if
released.
| The Immigration Judge's decision is supplemented by a memorandum dated July 26, 2019.
2 The respondent argues on appeal that the Immigration Judge should have reconsidered his risk
of flight in light of the facts that the Ninth Circuit has scheduled oral argument in his case and
appointed pro bono counsel. We disagree. When an administratively final removal order is in
effect, an Immigration Judge conducted a custody review determination is entitled to rely on
that order, and need not revisit the merits of the underlying claim. Rodriguez v. Holder,
2013 WL 5229795, at *2 (explaining that “[s]uch a requirement would require legal and political
analyses beyond what would otherwise be considered at a bond hearing, and would place an
unreasonable burden on overly burdened Immigration Judges”).

-451
Although the Immigration Judge's flight risk determination was not improper, we nonetheless
conclude that the record must be remanded for further fact-finding regarding the practicability of
alternatives to detention. The fact that the respondent poses a flight risk justifies his continued
detention only if there is no amount of bond that would be reasonably calculated to ensure his
future appearance, either for removal or for future hearings. In her bond memorandum, the
Immigration Judge states in a footnote that the respondent's flight risk “could not be ameliorated
by the imposition of reasonable bond” (IJ Memo at 3 n.2), but that statement is not explained
or supported by reference to any facts in evidence. Further, if payment of a bond is
impracticable, the Immigration Judge should consider other alternatives to detention or explain
why they are unavailable. Rodriguez v. Holder, 2013 WL 5229795, at *2; Hernandez v. Lynch,
2016 WL 7116611, at *25.
The following order will be issued.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion
and for entry of a new decision.
