In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Christopher M. Casazza, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondent is a native and citizen of Indonesia. He has filed an untimely motion to reopen,
alleging changed country conditions for Chinese Christians. The Department of Homeland
Security has not responded to the motion, which will be granted.
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent's testimony was not credible and therefore
that he did not establish his identity as a Christian (1) at 3-5). In his motion, the respondent
contends that he is a Christian and that reopening is warranted due to a recent increase in religious
intolerance and religiously motivated violence against Christians in his native country of Indonesia.
The respondent asserts that Muslim extremists now target Christians and that it is no longer safe
for Christians in Indonesia. In support of the motion, the respondent has submitted his Indonesian
birth certificate and baptismal certificate, and well as a letter from the church where he was
baptized in Indonesia. He has also submitted extensive background evidence regarding recent
conditions in Indonesia.

With limited exceptions, a motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry
of a final administrative order of deportation or removal. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2). There is
no time or number limit on the filing of a motion to reopen if the basis of the motion is to apply
for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal based on changed country conditions or
circumstances arising in the country of nationality or the country to which deportation or removal
has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been
discovered or presented at the previous proceeding. See section 240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act;
8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. 247 (BIA 2007), aff'd Shao v. Mukasey,
546 F.3d 138 (2d Cir. 2008); Matter of A-N- & R-M-N-, 22 I&N Dec. 953, 956 (BIA 1999).
Motions to reopen are disfavored and strict limits endorsed in removal proceedings where
every delay works to the advantage of an alien illegally residing in the United States who wishes
to remain. Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 252. The movant must establish prima facie
eligibility for the relief sought, INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 319 (1992); INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S.
94, 104-05 (1988), and has the heavy burden of demonstrating that the “new evidence offered
would likely change the result in the case.” Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N Dec. at 251, quoting Matter
of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992).

1-552
The evidence submitted with the motion is sufficient to establish changed conditions or
circumstances in Indonesia material to the respondent's eligibility for asylum, withholding of
removal, and Convention Against Torture protection. The respondent has submitted additional
evidence indicating that he was baptized as a Christian and is a practicing Christian (Motion, Exhs.
2, 3, 5, 7). Although the Immigration Judge found that the respondent was not credible, he did not
specifically find that the respondent was not a Christian, a question to be further considered on
remand.'
In addition, the background evidence shows that religious extremism and violence has
worsened in Indonesia against Christians (Motion, Exhs. 9-24). Although religious extremism,
violence, and discrimination existed at the time of the respondent's 2004 hearing, as is reflected in
the documents submitted at the time, see e.g., Exh. 2A, the respondent has shown materially
changed circumstances for Christians in Indonesia. See Liem v. Att 'y Gen., 921 F.3d 388 (3d Cir.
2019).
Based on the foregoing, the motion to reopen is granted and the record is remanded for further
proceedings in accordance with this decision.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this
decision.
