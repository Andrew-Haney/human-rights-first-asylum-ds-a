IN ASYLUM AND/OR WITHHOLDING PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Emesto A. Sanchez, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: William M. Hunt
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The applicant, a native and citizen of Guatemala, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated August 29, 2018, denying her applications for withholding of removal pursuant to
section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3), and protection
under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c)-.18. The Department
of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded.

We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
i
An alien in withholding-only proceedings has the right to a reasonable opportunity to present
evidence on his or her behalf. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(a)(4); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.2(c)(3) (stating
that withholding-only proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the same rules of
procedure as removal proceedings). At the outset of the hearing on August 28, 2018, the
Immigration Judge questioned the applicant about her previous encounters with immigration
officials (Tr. at 23-40). Based on the applicant's responses to these questions, the Immigration
Judge found that she was not a credible witness and denied her applications based solely on that
negative credibility determination (Tr. at 32; IJ at 14-16). Because the applicant was not provided
the opportunity to testify in support of her claim, we will remand the record for further proceedings.
On remand, both parties shall be permitted to update the record with additional evidence and
to make additional legal arguments. After the parties have been given the opportunity to present
additional evidence, the Immigration Judge should render a new credibility finding and further
consider whether the applicant has met her burden of proof. In doing so, the Immigration Judge
should specifically identify any evidence relied on and explain the reasons for his conclusions in
his decision. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002); Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468,
474 (BIA 1999).

In remanding, we express no opinion regarding the merits of the applicant's applications. See
Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 422 (BIA 1996). The following order shall be entered.
ORDER: The record is be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and the
entry of a new decision.
