In re: S
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Lucero Chavez, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
George Francis
Assistant Chief Counsel
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has filed an interlocutory appeal from the
Immigration Judge's July 6, 2017, decision administratively closing the respondent's proceedings.
Ordinarily the Board does not entertain interlocutory appeals. See Matter of M-D-, 24 I&N
Dec. 138, 139 (BIA 2007), and cases cited therein. We have on occasion accepted interlocutory
appeals to address significant jurisdictional questions about the administration of the immigration
laws, or to correct recurring problems in the handling of cases by Immigration Judges. See, e.g.,
Matter of Guevara, 20 I&N Dec. 238 (BIA 1990, 1991); Matter of Dobere, 20 I&N Dec. 188
(BIA 1990). The issue of whether the Immigration Judge properly administratively closed the
respondent's proceedings does not present a significant jurisdictional question about the
administration of the immigration laws. Nor does it involve a recurring problem in Immigration
Judges' handling of cases. The question raised in this interlocutory appeal does not fall within the
limited ambit of cases where we would exercise our jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record shall be returned to the Immigration Court with no further action.

In the Matter of:
W
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
Respondent
APPLICATION:
Motion for Administrative Closure.
ORDER OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
I. Procedural Posture
W S-S (the respondent) is a native and a citizen of Guatemala who has
been placed into removal proceedings and charged with being removable pursuant to Section
212(a)(O)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). On January 23, 2014, the
Department of Homeland Security (the Department) commenced these removal proceedings by
the filing of a Notice to Appear (NTA) with the Immigration Court sitting in Los Angeles,
California. See Exhibit 1 & 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
On May 9, 2017, the respondent admitted factual allegations one to four of the NTA and
conceded the charge. Based on the respondent's admission and concession, the undersigned
Immigration Judge found the respondent inadmissible as charged and directed Guatemala as the
country for removal.
On March 15, 2017, the respondent filed a “Motion for Administrative Closure” (Motion).
In support of the Motion, the respondent filed evidence that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Service (CIS) approved on March 6, 2017, a Form I-360 (Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or
Special Immigrant) (1360 petition) based on the Special Immigrant Juvenile findings of a state
court. INA $ 101(a)(27)(J).
1. Special Immigrant Juvenile findings by a state court require that the petitioner be placed under the
custody of another; that reunification with one or both parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect,
abandonment, or a similar basis; and that it is in the best interest of the petitioner not to return to his or her
country of nationality or of last habitual residence. See Cal. C.C.P. § 155(b)(1) (setting forth the factual
findings to be made by California Courts).

II. Basis for the Motion
The basis for the Motion is the pending availability of a SIJ visa. See INA
203(b)(4)(delineating the availability of special immigrant visas and stating that SIJ Visas are such
visas, citing INA § 101(a)(27)(J)). Special immigrant visas are categorized as fourth preference
employment based (EB4) visas and are subject to availability. Id. & INA § 202(a)(2). The
current Visa lletin from the U.S. Department of State shows that B4 visas are currently over
subscribed for the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. See
travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/bulletin. Once an EB4 visa is available, the
respondent will be eligible to adjust status in the United States either before the Immigration Court,
or, if these proceedings are terminated at such juncture, before CIS. INA $$ 245(a) & 245(h).
The Department has stated that its policy is to oppose administrative closure in situations
such as the respondent’s but it does not oppose a continuance to await the availability of an EB4
visa. The Department has not noted any specific opposition based on the respondent's
ineligibility for the relief nor has it filed a response to the respondent's Motion.
III. Statement of the Applicable Law
In Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012), the Board of Immigration Appeals
(Board) reviewed when it is appropriate for an Immigration Judge to administratively close
proceedings over a party's objections. In Avetisyan, the Board notes in preliminary observations
that administrative closure is a tool for Immigration Judges to use to manage their court calendars
for the efficient use of the limited Immigration Court resources. 25 I&N Dec. at 695. The Board
notes that the Immigration Judge's authority to regulate the course of removal proceedings
provides for the use of such a tool. Id. at 692 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.10(b)). The Board explicitly
notes that both continuances and administrative closure are tools at the Immigration Judge's
disposal. Id. The Board notes that continuances may be appropriate to await additional action
required of the parties that will be, or is expected to be, completed within a reasonably certain and
brief amount of time. Id. In contrast, administrative closure may be appropriate to await an action
or event that is relevant to immigration proceedings but is outside the control of the parties or the
court and may not occur for a significant or undetermined period. Id.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
In Avetisyan, the Board emphatically states that an Immigration Judge may not abdicate
his responsibility to exercise independent judgment and discretion by permitting one party's
opposition to administrative closure to dictate the Court's actions. Id. at 694. To provide
guidance, the Board notes it is appropriate to consider all relevant factors presented in a case,
includir but not limited to (1) the reason administrative closure is ught; the basis for any
opposition to administrative closure; (3) the likelihood the respondent will succeed on any petition;
(4) the anticipated duration of the closure; (5) the responsibility of either party, if any, in
contributing to any current or anticipated delay; and (6) the ultimate outcome of removal
proceeding. Id. at 696.
In Matter of W-Y-U-, 27 I&N Dec. 17 (BIA 2017), the Board found that the Immigration
2
Judge erred in concluding that the matter did not present an actual case in dispute given the
respondent's desire to seek asylum. 27 I&N at 18-19. The Board also found that it is irrelevant
in consideration of administrative closure whether the matter before the Court is an enforcement
priority for the Department, as such is not dispositive of whether the case is in dispute. Id. at 19.
Finally, the Board clarified its holding in Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012), and
held that the primary consideration for an Immigration Judge in determining whether to
administratively close or recalendar proceedings is whether the party opposing administrative
closure has provided a persuasive reason for the case to proceed and be resolved on the merits.
Id. at 20.
IV. Analysis & Findings
Although the exact period to await the availability of an EB4 visa is uncertain, resources
are available to help predict the timeframe. The Visa Bulletin from the U.S. Department of State
sets-forth the priority dates for overprescribed petitions so that an applicant can see when their visa
may become available. See travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/bulletin. Although
only an estimate, it is important that both the respondent and the Department can thereby stay
abreast of the likely wait on the availability of an EB4 visa and leam when the respondent may be
eligible for relief.
Given the issuance of a predicate order by the Califomia Superior Court and the approval
of the 1360 petition, it appears that the respondent is prima facie eligible to adjust status in the
United States once an EB4 visa becomes available. Even though the adjustment provisions for
special immigrant juveniles are generous, they do not waive all inadmissibility categories.
Accordingly, the respondent must still show that he is not inadmissible for turpitudinous offenses,
for multiple convictions resulting in confinement of five years or more, or for being involved in
the illicit trafficking of a controlled substance. See INA Ⓡ$ 212(a)(2)(A), (2)(B), & (2)(C).
Additionally, he must show that he is not inadmissible due to involvement in terrorist activities or
on security grounds. See INA 88 212(a)(3)(A), (3)(B), (3)(C), & (3)(E). The Department has not
made any allegations that the respondent would be inadmissible based on any of these grounds.

“Unaccompanied Children” (UC) cases are no longer priority cases for the Executive
Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). On January 31, 2017, Immigration Judges nationwide
were informed that detained respondents would be the priority of the EOIR and the previous
prioritization of UC cases was rescinded. See EOIR OCIJ Memo: Case Processing Priorities
(Jan. 31, 2017) available at www.lexisnexis.com/legalnews room/immigration. The only UC
cases included in the hierarchy of priority cases are those wherein the minor is in the care of the
Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and ORR has not identified a sponsor. Such is not the
situation herein.
Those immigration judges handling the former priority UC cases will have to accommodate
priority cases in addition to the UC cases on their dockets. Furthermore, due to training and
experience, these immigration judges continue to handle UC cases, and can expect to continue to
receive large quantities of these cases in the future in spite of the shifting of priorities. Statistics
3
for the last four fiscal years from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol show that apprehensions of
unaccompanied children for fiscal year 2016 were 59,692, which is second only to fiscal year
2014. See “United States Border Patrol Southwest Family Unit Subject and Unaccompanied Alien
Children Apprehensions Fiscal Year 2016” available at https://www.cbp/gov/newsroom/stats/
southwest-border-unaccompanied-children/fy-2016. Therefore, Immigration Judges handling
these dockets will continue to have large numbers of UC cases to balance against the now
prioritized detained cases.
Considering the preliminary observations of the Board in Avetisyan, in addition to the
above factors, the Court notes that the Board expressly noted that Immigration Judges have the
responsibility of managing their calendars for the efficient use of limited Immigration Court
resources. Avetisyan, 25 I&N Dec. at 695. This admonishment and guidance seems now more
topical than ever giving the shifting priorities of the Immigration Courts but the continued
migration of unaccompanied children to the United States. Furthermore, the Board expressly
noted that administrative closure is appropriate when the event or action relevant to immigration
proceedings is outside the control of the parties or the court and may not occur for a significant or
undetermined period. Id. at 692. The availability of an EB4 visa is outside the control of the parties
and the court. Furthermore, although there are parameters for knowing an approximate period of
visa attendance, the exact period is of significant duration and undetermined. Therefore, it appears
these factors weigh in favor of administrative closure.
The six delineated factors established in Avetisyan also weigh in favor of administrative
closure. The respondent seeks administrative closure as a means to reduce attendance at court
hearings. The Court also notes the Department generalized opposition to administrative closure
rather than any specific reference to disqualifying factors herein and its past agreement to
continuances to await the availability of EB4 visas based on SIJ visa petitions. The Court also
notes that moving forward with removal proceedings while viable relief for the respondent is
available outside of these proceedings may result in the wasteful use of limited court resources and
the strong possibility of having to reopen proceedings later.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The remaining delineated factors weigh in favor of administrative closure. The likelihood
of success, as noted above, is strong given the previous findings from the state court and the
absence of any negative factors to indicate possible inadmissibility. Although the Court makes no
predication as to how it will rule on a future adjustment application, if the respondent seeks to
adjust in removal proceedings, the likely outcome of the removal proceedings is to proceed to such
an application or to terminate so that the respondent may seek to adjust before CIS. Given the
current waiting times for EB4 visa availability, the duration of administrative closure could be
about two years, but neither the
nor the De ent has contributed to delays in this
matter. The respondent has shown deliberate speed in identifying relief, filing the request for the
predicate order with state court, and filing the 1360 petition with CIS. The Department promptly
placed the respondent into removal proceedings after the respondent's arrival in the United States
and has zealously prosecuted this matter.
The Court also notes that there is no pending relief presently before the Immigration Court.

{ "
Both parties have found it in their interest to continue these proceedings so that the respondent
may await the availability of an EB4 visa that would permit the respondent to seek adjustment of
status either before the Court or before the CIS. Therefore, the Court is not able to find that either
party has provided a persuasive reason for the case to proceed to be resolved on the merits at this
time. See Matter of W-Y-U-27 I&N Dec. 17, 20 (BIA 2017)(wherein the Board clarified Avetisyan
by noting that this is the primary consideration for the IJ in deciding whether to administratively
close or recalendar a matter).
V. Conclusion
Pursuant to its analysis of the delineated factors in Avetisyan, the preliminary observations
noted therein, the factors related to docket management, and the Board's recent decision in Matter
of W-Y-U-, the Court believes administrative closure is the proper action to take in this matter at
this time. The Court notes that this action will permit it to use its limited resources for now priority
cases. At the same time, the Court will be able to respond adequately through a motion to
recalendar, if intervening factors require the Court's attention to this matter before the availability
of an EB4 visa or once the respondent is eligible to seek to adjust status. Accordingly, the Court
enters the following order.
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that these proceedings be ADMINISTRATIVELY
