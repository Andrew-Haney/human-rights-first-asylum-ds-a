In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Rachel L. Rado, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; remand
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ecuador, timely appeals an Immigration Judge's
October 28, 2019, decision. The Immigration Judge found the respondent removable as charged,
denied his applications for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant to sections 208 and
241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &$ 1158 and 1231(b)(3), respectively,
and protection under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2), and
ordered the respondent removed. On appeal, the respondent contests the denial of all three forms
of relief and protection. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further action
consistent with this decision.

The respondent was determined to be an “unaccompanied alien child” (“UAC”) when he
entered the United States on September 30, 2013 Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”)
Verification of Release). At that time, he was 16 years old. The respondent was placed in removal
proceedings. The respondent filed an application for asylum (Form 1-589) with the United States
Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USICS”) on or about August 5, 2014 (Tr. at 4-5; Exh. 3).
The respondent was still under the age of 18 when he filed his application (Tr. at 2-3, 4-5; Exh. 3).
His application appears to have still been pending with USCIS at the time of his removal hearing
(IJ Dec. dated 8/5/14 administratively closing case; Tr. at 11-17, 20-21, 26).
As the respondent was designated a UAC and filed his asylum application prior to attaining
the age of 18, USCIS had initial jurisdiction over his application pursuant to the provisions of the
William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”),
Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044. Section 235(d)(7)(B) of the TVPRA, codified at section
208(b)(3)(C) of the Act, provides that “[a]n asylum officer ... shall have initial jurisdiction over
any asylum application filed by an unaccompanied alien child ...." The term “unaccompanied
alien child” is defined in the Act by reference to “section 462(g) of the Homeland Security Act of
2002 (6 U.S.C. $ 279(g)),” which in tum defines the term as “a child who (A) has no lawful
immigration status in the United States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect
to whom (i) there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal
guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody.” See also
Matter of M-A-C-0-, 27 I&N Dec. 477 (BIA 2018) (holding that an Immigration Judge has initial
jurisdiction over asylum applications filed by UACs if first filed after the applicant reaches age
18, but that otherwise USCIS has initial jurisdiction over any asylum application filed by an UAC).

On the record before us, we conclude that a remand is necessary to allow USCIS to complete
its adjudication of the respondent's application.1.2 As we are remanding this matter, we need not
reach the respondent's additional arguments, including his arguments contesting the Immigration
Judge's denial of relief, and his assertion of Immigration Judge bias.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further action consistent with
the foregoing opinion.

1
The Immigration Judge did not provide any legal authority for his apparent adoption of the
government attorney's contention that the respondent's detention after he filed his asylum
application stripped USCIS of jurisdiction over the application, nor are we aware of any such
authority. See, e.g., section 208(b)(3)(C) of the Act; 6 U.S.C. $ 279(g).
2 We note that there may be an issue on remand as to whether the respondent was still an UAC at
the time he filed his asylum application, insofar as the record suggests he was released from ORR
custody into the custody of his mother. See generally Matter of M-A-C-O-, 27 I&N Dec. at 480
(noting that “UAC status is not static, as both a UAC's age and his or her accompaniment may
change”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Given that no factual findings were
made on this issue, we are unable to resolve it on appeal. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv).
