IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carlos M. Polanco, Esquire
CHARGE:
Notice: Sec.
212(a)(1)(A)(1)(I), I&N Act [8 U.S.C. $ 1182(a)(7)(A)(1)(I)] -
Immigrant - no valid immigrant visa or entry document
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent appeals from the Immigration Judge's January 20, 2016, decision denying his
application for asylum under section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1158, withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and
protection under the Convention Against Torture, and ordering him removed to Bangladesh. The
appeal will be sustained.

The respondent, a 20-year-old native and citizen of Bangladesh, claims that he joined the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 2011, and that he was appointed to a leadership position
in his BNP student wing (Tr. at 377-80). He testified that because of his active involvement in
the BNP, Awami League (AL) members physically assaulted him in February of 2013, and in
December of 2014, and both beatings resulted in unconsciousness and hospitalizations of 7 days
and 5 days, respectively (Tr. at 380-84, 388-90). The respondent also received death threats by
AL members during the December of 2014 confrontation (Tr. at 388-90). The respondent was
also effectively chased out of college and prevented from taking an exam by AL members, his
family's store was vandalized and robbed, and, in an incident that was specifically linked to him,
the respondent's mother and father were physically attacked when members of the AL could not
find him (Tr. at 387, 388, 396). He then left Bangladesh in March of 2015, arrived in the United
States in June of 2015, and he ſiled for asylum in November of 2015. The respondent testified
that he did not file a police report because BNP leaders advised his father that it was useless to
report to the police because the police were associated with the AL that was in power, they had
refused to take others' reports, and they had even filed false cases against other accusers (Tr. at
382-84).
The Immigration Judge found the respondent's testimony to be credible and that the harm the
respondent endured was on account of his political opinion (I.J. at 12, 17). The Immigration
Judge found that even though the respondent appears to have lost consciousness both times he
was attacked, the mistreatment he experienced did not rise to the level of past persecution (I.J. at
18). The Immigration Judge also found that even assuming that the harm the respondent
Cite as: H-B-, AXXX XXX 608 (BIA July 26, 2016)
608
experienced rose to the level akin to persecution, the respondent failed to demonstrate that he
was persecuted by the government of Bangladesh or persons the government of Bangladesh is
unable or unwilling to control (I.J. at 18, 19; Matter of A-M-, 23 I&N Dec. 737, 741 (BIA 2005).
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent's belief that the police would not be responsive
does not convincingly demonstrate that the Bangladeshi goverment in general cannot and will
not control the violence against the respondent perpetrated by members of the AL's student wing
(I.J. at 19).
The respondent maintains on appeal that the Immigration Judge erred as a matter of law in
determining that he did not suffer harm sufficiently severe to rise to the level of past persecution
(Resp. Brief at 24-27). Upon de novo review, we disagree with the Immigration Judge that,
notwithstanding the respondent's credible testimony, he did not carry his burden of proof to
establish that the past mistreatment he experienced was sufficiently severe to qualify as
persecution (I.J. at 18).
Past persecution is an extreme concept and does not include every form of mistreatment that
our society regards as offensive. See Gonzalez v. Reno, 212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir. 2000);
see also Shi v. United States Attorney General, 707 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2013). Although
the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the jurisdiction in which this case
arises, does not impose a rigid definition for persecution, it defines harm rising to that level as
"requir[ing]... more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,
unaccompanied by any physical punishment, infliction of harm, or significant deprivation of
liberty.” See Gonzalez v. Reno, supra, at 1355; see also Shi v. United States Attorney General,
supra, at 1235; Sepulveda v. United States Attorney General, 401 F.3d 1226, 1231
(11th Cir. 2005). When considering whether past persecution has been established, we are
required to examine the cumulative effects of any alleged mistreatment. See Delgado
v. United States Attorney General, 487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir. 2007), citing Ruiz v. Gonzales,
479 F.3d 762, 766 (11th Cir. 2007); see also Mejia v. United States Attorney General,
498 F.3d 1253, 1257-58 (11th Cir. 2007).

We conclude, when considering the treatment cumulatively, that the respondent's encounters
with AL members were pervasive enough and accompanied by sufficiently severe harm to
qualify as persecution. Moreover, as noted above, the Immigration Judge determined that the
harm endured was on account of the respondent's political opinion (I.J. at 17).
Where the respondent expresses fear of harm from private actors, he must also establish that
the government is unable or unwilling to protect him from these individuals (I.J. at 18, 19). See
Malu v. United States Attorney General, 764 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir. 2014); Ayala v. United
States Attorney General, 605 F.3d 941, 950 (11th Cir. 2010); Lopez v. United States Attorney
General, 504 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir. 2007); Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211, 222 (BIA
1985). Merely alleging governnent inaction is not enough; the respondent must show that the
governınent condoned the private conduct or at least demonstrated a complete helplessness or
unwillingness to protect the victim. The respondent testified that his father was advised by local
BNP leaders not to report the incident to the police as doing so would be futile or lead to adverse
consequences (Tr. at 382-84; Respondent's Brief at 32). This is supported by the country
conditions evidence of record, specifically the Bangladesh 2014 Human Rights Report (Country
2

608
Report), which indicates that political violence is widespread, there were reports that the
government (which is controlled by the Awami League) or its agents committed arbitrary or
unlawful killings, that official corruption and impunity remained a problem, and that no cases
involving security force abuse and killing resulted in criminal punishment (Respondent's Brief at
32; Exh. 2, Tab 9). Given the documented politically motivated violence in the country
condition evidence together with the respondent's testimony that local BNP leaders advised his
father not to report the abuse, we conclude that the Immigration Judge's finding that the
government of Bangladesh is willing or able to control the respondent's persecutors is clearly
erroneous.
Having demonstrated past persecution, the respondent is presumed to have a well-founded
fear of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). The Department of Homeland Security
bears the burden of rebutting that presumption. See Matter of H-, 21 I&N Dec. 337 (BIA 1996);
see also 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b). The record contains no evidence that would rebut the
presumption and there is no indication that the respondent would refrain from active BNP
participation upon return to Bangladesh. Therefore, we conclude that the respondent is
statutorily eligible for asylum pursuant to section 208 of the Act. Accordingly, the following
orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
opportunity to complete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or
examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by
8 C.F.R.S 1003.47(h).
