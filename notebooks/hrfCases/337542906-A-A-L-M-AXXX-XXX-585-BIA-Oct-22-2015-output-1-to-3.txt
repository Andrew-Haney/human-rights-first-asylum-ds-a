IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Roberto Matus, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Matthew Kovachy
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, has filed a timely appeal from the
Immigration Jucge's June 13, 2008, decision denying her application for asylum and withholding
of removal and her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The record will
be remanded.

The Immigration Judge found that, due to inconsistencies, the respondent was not credible
regarding her claim that she was abused over a period of years by her husband in Nicaragua. As
the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not mention fear of her husband when she first
entered the United States. However, she testified that she was afraid at that point, the person
questioning her was "aggressive," and she feared she would be deported. Tr. at 59. The
respondent reiterated this claim during a credible fear interview conducted some weeks later, and
also then made the claims about her fear of her husband.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, where this case arises, has noted
that the reliability of an airport or border interview may be affected by an alien's feeling
intimidated by official questioning or due to coercive experiences in the country of origin. See
Tang v. U.S. Aity. Gen., 578 F.3d 1270 (11th Cir. 2009). Further, although the Immigration
Judge in this case discussed some discrepancies in the dates when the respondent stated she was
abused and went to the hospital, the overall claim, from the credible fear interview, the asylum
application, and the respondent's testimony, is that the respondent suffered regular abuse, not
just several instances of abuse that required hospitalization. The respondent also supported her
claim with documentary evidence indicating that she was abused, although the Immigration
Judge found this evidence suspect and expressed the view that the respondent was "tailoring her
oral testimony‚Äù based on the documentary evidence. I.J. at 11.
Given the overall consistency of the respondent's claim and the documentary evidence
supporting it, we find the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility determination to be clearly
erroneous, and that finding will be reversed.

The Immigration Judge also found that, assuming the abuse occurred, it was not inflicted on
account of the respondent's membership in a particular social group or other protected ground.
Since the time of the respondent's hearing, the Board has issued several decisions addressing the
issue of particular social group, including the question whether domestic violence can form the
basis for an asylum claim. See Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014), and Matter of
W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014) (clarifying what is required to establish a particular social
group); Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra (discussing particular social group in the context of cases
involving domestic violence). These decisions may have an impact on the respondent's case,
and warrant a remand. On remand, the parties should be given the opportunity to present
additional evidence and arguments regarding particular social group and nexus, as they may
apply to this case, as well as any other relevant issues.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent was not credible is reversed.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion, and for the entry of a new decision.
