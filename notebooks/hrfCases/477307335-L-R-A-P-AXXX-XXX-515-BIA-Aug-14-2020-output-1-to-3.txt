IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Shawna Howard, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum, withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondents are a mother and her minor child, natives and citizens of Honduras. They
appeal from an August 15, 2018, decision of an Immigration Judge, denying applications for
asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Sections
208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.16 – 1208.18. The respondents filed a brief concerning the decision of the Immigration
Judge, while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The
case will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondents contend that the Immigration Judge erred, as he did not provide the lead
respondent with an opportunity to offer testimony in support of the applications for relief and
protection at a full evidentiary hearing (Respondents’ Br. at 4-8). We agree.
An applicant for asylum has a statutory right to "a reasonable opportunity ... to present
evidence.” Section 240(b)(4)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(B). In assessing whether an
alien has met the burden of proving eligibility for relief from removal, the statute provides that
“the immigration judge shall weigh the credible testimony with other evidence of record.”
Section 240(c)(4)(B) of the Act.
The regulations mandate that applications for asylum and withholding of removal will be
decided by the Immigration Judge "after an evidentiary hearing to resolve factual issues in
dispute,” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(c)(3), and that during the removal hearing, the respondent “shall be
examined under oath on his or her application and may present evidence and witnesses in his or
her own behalf.” 8 C.F.R. § 1240.11(c)(3)(iii).

-515 et al.

The Board has held that, in most cases, the testimony of a respondent, beyond asking whether
the information in the application is complete and correct, is pivotal to a fair asylum proceeding.
Matter of Fefe, 20 I&N Dec. 116, 118 (BIA 1989) (stating that, “[i]n the ordinary course ...
consider the full examination of an applicant to be an essential aspect of the asylum adjudication
process for reasons related to fairness to the parties and to the integrity of the asylum process
itself.”). Therein, the Board recognized the importance of considering the oral testimony of an
asylum applicant, stating that there are cases where an alien establishes eligibility for asylum by
means of his oral testimony when such eligibility would not have been established by the
documents alone.” See also Atemnkeng v. Barr, 948 F.3d 231, 242 (4th Cir. 2020) (remanding for
testimony, citing Matter of Fefe, and observing that the Board in Fefe "emphasized how important
it is for an IJ to consider an [asylum] applicant's live testimony"); Matter of E-F-H-L-,
26 I&N Dec. 319, 323-24 (BIA 2014) (acknowledging that Immigration Judges have a duty to
fully develop the record), vacated on other grounds by Matter of E-F-H-L-, 27 I&N Dec. 226
(A.G. 2018); Respondents’ Br. at 7-9.
The Board noted an exception to the requirement of testimony in the situation in which the
parties stipulate that “the applicant's testimony would be entirely consistent with the written
materials and that the oral statement would be believably presented.” Matter of Fefe, 20 I&N Dec.
at 118. The parties entered into no such stipulation here. Rather, the Immigration Judge stated
that by signing her 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, the lead
respondent agreed that the application and supporting documentation was true and correct
(Tr. at 16; Exh. 3), but the respondents did not request that the application be decided without
consideration of the lead respondent's own testimony.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Because the Immigration Judge evaluated the respondents' claim based solely on the asylum
application, the Form 1-870, “Record of Determination/Credible Fear Worksheet," and the lead
respondent's declaration (Exhs. 2, 3, 5) without taking any testimony from the lead respondent
(IJ at 2-4, 6-7; Tr. at 15-19), under the circumstances the respondents were prevented from fully
and fairly presenting their case.
We therefore find that a remand to the Immigration Court is warranted in order to permit the
respondents to present their claims at an appropriate hearing. At such a hearing, the respondents
must indicate the exact delineation of any proposed particular social group” that they present.
Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 344 (A.G. 2018). Accordingly, the following orders shall be
entered.
ORDER: The respondents' appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The records are remanded to the Immigration Court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.
