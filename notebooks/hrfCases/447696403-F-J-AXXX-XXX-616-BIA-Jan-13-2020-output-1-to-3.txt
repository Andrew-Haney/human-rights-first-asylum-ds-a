In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL AND MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: James A. Feroli, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Nicole Schroeder
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
This case is before the Board pursuant to a June 18, 2019, order of the Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit granted the Government's motion to remand in light of the
intervening decision in Rodriguez-Arias v. Whitaker, 915 F.3d 968 (4th Cir. 2019). On remand
from the Fourth Circuit, the respondent filed a motion to remand the record to the Immigration
Judge. The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) opposed the respondent's motion to
remand with respect to his withholding of removal claim, but requests that the Board remand the
record to the Immigration Judge to reconsider the respondent's application for protection under
the Convention Against Torture. The respondent's motion will be granted and the record will be
remanded.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. & 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. & 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Fourth Circuit held in Rodriguez-Arias v. Whitaker that when determining whether an
applicant for protection under the Convention Against Torture is more likely than not to be tortured
in a particular country, the risks of torture from all sources should be combined to assess whether
the probability of torture exceeds 50%. Rodriguez-Arias v. Whitaker, 915 F.3d at 973. The
likelihood that an event will occur in the future is a factual finding that must be determined by the
Immigration Judge. See Matter of 2-2-O-, 26 I&N Dec. 586, 590 (BIA 2015). Thus, we will
remand the record for the Immigration Judge to make additional factual findings regarding the
likelihood that the respondent will suffer harm constituting torture in Iraq. See Matter of S-H-,
23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (noting that the Board has limited fact-finding authority and
must rely on Immigration Judges to make clear and complete findings of fact). On remand, the
parties may submit any additional evidence relevant to whether the respondent will be harmed
upon return to Iraq.
In his brief and motion following remand, the respondent alleges that his mental illness will
contribute to the likelihood that he will be harmed upon return to Iraq. To the extent the respondent
claims that the Immigration Judge erred in not implementing sufficient safeguards under
Cite as: F-J-, AXXX XXX 616 (BIA Jan. 13, 2020)
-616
Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474 (BIA 2011), and in not considering whether the respondent's
mental illness rendered him a member of a particular social group (Respondent's Br. at 10-22),
these arguments are unsupported by the record. After finding the respondent not competent to
participate in his removal proceedings, the Immigration Judge implemented various safeguards to
ensure due process (IJ at 4-5). See Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 481-83. The respondent,
who was represented by counsel before the Immigration Judge and on appeal, did not request any
additional safeguards and did not challenge the adequacy of those safeguards on appeal (IJ at 4;
Respondent's Br., Oct. 16, 2018). See Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., 529 U.S. 460, 469 (2000)
(noting the general rule that “issues must be raised in lower courts in order to be preserved as
potential grounds of decision in higher courts”); Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2
(BIA 2012) (noting that issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived). The respondent also did
not claim before the Immigration Judge or on appeal that he was a member of a particular social
group based on his mental illness or that he feared harm in Iraq based on his mental illness. See
Matter of W-Y-C- & H-O-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 189, 191 (BIA 2018) (noting that the alien must clearly
indicated on the record before the Immigration Judge the exact delineation of his or her proposed
particular social group). The respondent cannot now argue that the Immigration Judge erred in
not addressing a claim he did not raise.'
Mental competency, however, is not a static condition. See Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at
480. Thus, if the parties have additional evidence bearing upon the respondent's competency and
the necessity of additional procedural safeguards, this evidence should be submitted on remand.
See Matter of J-S-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 679, 682 (BIA 2015) (discussing the collaborative approach to
ensuring that the record is fully developed regarding a respondent's competency). Additionally,
although we agree with the DHS that the respondent has not established prima facie eligibility for
withholding of removal based on his mental illness (DHS’s Br. at 8-9), the respondent may submit
additional evidence on remand. Thus, on remand the Immigration Judge should reassess the
respondent's eligibility for protection under the Convention Against Torture based on
Rodriguez-Arias v. Whitaker. She may also consider any other issues she deems appropriate,
including the respondent's claim that he is eligible for withholding of removal based on his mental
illness. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.

ORDER: The respondent's motion to remand is granted.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

FOR THE BOARD
1
To the extent the respondent's prior counsel erred in not raising these claims, the respondent
has not satisfied the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under
Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).
