IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Nataly E. Cabrera, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Shannon Simmons
Assistant Chief Counsel
.....
APPLICATION: Remand
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, has appealed from an Immigration Judge's
December 20, 2018, decision deeming his asylum application abandoned due to his failure to
obtain biometrics and ordering him removed. The respondent's appeal will be sustained, and the
record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this
order.

We'review the Immigration Judge's findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(C)(3)(1).
We review questions of law, discretion and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo.
8°C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Alvarado de Rodriguez v. Holder, 585 F.3d 227; 234-35 (5th
Cir. 2009) (discussing Board's review of factual findings).
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in deeming his application
for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture to be
abandoned. He maintains that the Immigration Judge did not give him a deadline for compliance
with the biometric requirements and therefore did not issue proper notice in compliance with
12To!;fiili
Matter of D-M-C-P-, 26 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 2015), and 8 C.F.R. 1003.47(c).
The respondent further contends that he established good cause for not having complied with
the biometrics requirements before his December 20, 2018, hearing. He notes that he does not
read or write but he nevertheless acted diligently in obtaining assistance to complete his asylum
application, in filing the application in a timely manner, and in retaining an attorney to assist him
during his merits hearing. He also points out that he reasonably believed that his attorney was
going to assist him with the biometrics requirement, but his attorney did not arrange for a
biometrics appointment before the hearing. The respondent's biometrics appointment was
scheduled for December 27, 2018, and his attorney quit the day before the respondent's final
hearing.
In Matter of D-M-C-P-, we held that, “to ensure that an asylum applicant receives proper notice
of the biometrics requirements, the Immigration Judge should do all of the following on the record:
(1) ensure that the DHS has advised the applicant of the need to provide biometrics and other
biographical information and has furnished the appropriate instructions; (2) inform the applicant

-883
of the deadline for complying with the requirements of which he has been notified; and (3) inform
the applicant of the consequences of noncompliance, including the possibility that the application
will be deemed abandoned and dismissed, unless the failure to comply resulted from good cause.”
Matter of D-M-C-P-, 26 I&N Dec. at 648–49. In this case, the Immigration Judge did not inform
the respondent of a deadline for complying with the biometrics requirement (Tr. at 12). The
Immigration Judge therefore did not provide sufficient notice of the biometrics requirement and
erred in deeming the respondent's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection
under the Convention Against Torture abandoned. Accordingly, we reverse the Immigration
Judge's decision, and we remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
regarding the respondent's eligibility for relief from removal.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded to the Immigration
Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.
