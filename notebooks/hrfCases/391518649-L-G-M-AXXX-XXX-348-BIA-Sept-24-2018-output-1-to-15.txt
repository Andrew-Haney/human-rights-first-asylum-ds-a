IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Jonathan Grant
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; voluntary
departure
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
June 14, 2017, decision denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant
to sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158,
1231(b)(3), protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(C)-1208.18,
and voluntary departure under section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b). The record will
be remanded.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of
credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including
questions of judgment, discretion, and law, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The Immigration
Judge found both the respondent and his mother credible (IJ at 12).
The respondent's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the
Convention Against Torture is based on his fear of being harmed by criminal cartel members in
Mexico (IJ at 5-6). The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was ineligible for
asylum and withholding of removal under both the Act and the Convention Against Torture
because he has been convicted of a particularly serious crime (IJ at 2-5). The Immigration Judge
also concluded that the respondent did not meet his burden of proof to establish eligibility for
deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture because his fear of being tortured in
Mexico is speculative and because he did not establish that Mexican officials would acquiesce in
his torture by private actors (IJ at 5-6). The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent's
application for voluntary departure, concluding that he was not a person of good moral character
and did not establish that he warranted such relief in discretion (IJ at 6-8).
The respondent's removability is undisputed. According to the Immigration Judge, the
respondent is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he has been convicted of
a “particularly serious crime” within the meaning of sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 241(b)(3)(B)(ii)
of the Act (IJ at 2-5). The factual basis for that determination is the respondent's 2010 conviction
for driving while under the influence of alcohol with two or more prior DUI convictions within
10 years in violation of sections 23152(b) and 235469f
the Califomia Vehicle Code, for which he
348
was sentenced to 120 days in county jail (IJ at 4; Exh. 15 at 49-52). Specifically, although the
offense is not a particularly serious crime by virtue of its status as an aggravated felony, the
Immigration Judge nonetheless found it particularly serious based on the nature of the conduct
prohibited by sections 23152(b) and 23546 of the California Vehicle Code and the facts and
circumstances surrounding its commission (IJ at 3-5). The Immigration Judge also appears to have
considered the respondent's complete criminal history, including conduct that did not result in a
conviction, in assessing whether the respondent has been convicted of a particularly serious crime
(IJ at 3-4). The respondent challenges that determination on appeal, arguing that the offense does
not rise to the level of a “particularly serious crime.”
When an applicant for asylum and withholding of removal has been convicted of an offense
that is neither an aggravated felony nor a “particularly serious crime” based solely on its elements,
we assess the applicant's eligibility for protection by examining the nature of the conviction, the
type of sentence imposed, and the circumstances and underlying facts of the conviction.” Matter
of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336, 342 (BIA 2007); see also Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. 244,
247 (BIA 1982)).
We agree with the Immigration Judge that driving while intoxicated is an exceedingly
dangerous crime, and we in no way condone the respondent's actions. Accord Matter of
Siniauskas, 27 I&N Dec. 207 (BIA 2018). In our precedential decisions, however, we have
generally reserved the “particularly serious crime” designation for offenses of exceptional gravity.
See, e.g., Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 662 (BIA 2012) (possession of child pornography);
Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 343 (felony menacing involving the use or threatened use of a
deadly weapon); Matter of Y-L-, 23 I&N Dec. 270, 274 (A.G. 2002) (drug trafficking); Matter of
S-V-, 22 I&N Dec. 1306, 1308-09 (BIA 2000) (robbery), disagreed with on other grounds by
Zheng v. Ashcroft, 332 F.3d 1186, 1194-96 (9th Cir. 2003); Matter of L-S-J., 21 I&N Dec. 973,
975 (BIA 1997) (robbery with a deadly weapon); Matter of B-, 20 I&N Dec. 427, 429-30
(BIA 1991) (aggravated battery with a firearm); Matter of Garcia-Garrocho, 19 I&N Dec. 423,
425-26 (BIA 1986) (burglary of a dwelling while armed with a deadly weapon or causing injury
to another); Matter of Carballe, 19 I&N Dec. 357,360 (BIA 1986) (armed robbery with a firearm).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Not all serious crimes can be “particularly serious.” Indeed, we have expressly held that,
“except possibly in unusual circumstances we would not find a single conviction for a
misdemeanor offense to be a particularly serious crime.” Matter of Juarez, 19 I&N Dec. 664,
665 (BIA 1988) (finding no particularly serious crime where the applicant was convicted in a
municipal court for misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon). We have also concluded that
even serious felonies such as residential burglary and alien smuggling may not be particularly
serious on their facts. See Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. at 247 (holding that burglary with
intent to commit theft was not a particularly serious crime where there (was) no indication that
the [burglarized] dwelling was occupied or that the applicant was armed; nor (was) there any
indication of an aggravating circumstance."); Matter of L-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 645, 655-56 (BIA 1999)
(holding that alien smuggling was not a particularly serious crime, even though the offense posed
some risk to the alien hidden in the floor of a van, because “there [was) no indication the (applicant]
intended to ham the smuggled alien” and the applicant “did not, in fact, cause her harm."); see also
Alphonsus v. Holder, 705 F.3d 1031, 1048-49 (9th Cir. 2013) (stating, that the line must be drawn
so that particularly serious crimes are not a major proportion of crimes generally, that
Cite as: L-G-M-, AXXX XXX 348 (BIA Sept. 24, 2018)
1348
“particularly" in this context means “in a special or unusual degree,” or “to an extent greater than
in other cases or towards others,” and that the Board has generally adhered to the notion that only
relatively “grave” crimes are considered particularly serious, though not always)(internal quotation
marks omitted).
At the relevant time, section 23152(b) of California Vehicle Code (2010) stated that “[i]t is
unlawful for any person who has 0.08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood to
drive a vehicle.” Further, under section 23546(a) of the California Vehicle code—applicable
here—a defendant who has been convicted of two prior DUI offenses within the last 10 years is
subject to a sentence of imprisonment in the county jail for not less than 120 days nor more than
1 year. Neither statute requires any aggravating element in addition to the DUI recidivism), such
as injury to another person or damage to property. Cf. Avendano-Hernandez v. Lynch, 800 F.3d
1072, 1078 (9th Cir. 2015) (affirming this Board's determination that a conviction under California
Health & Safety Code § 23153(b) for driving under the influence and causing bodily injury to
another person is a particularly serious crime); Anaya-Ortiz v. Holder, 594 F.3d 673, 679-80
(9th Cir. 2010) (same). It does not appear that any of the respondent's DUI offenses involved an
accident, much less injury to a victim (IJ at 6; Exh. 15 at 49-52). See, e.g., Matter of R-A-M-,
25 I&N Dec. at 662; Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 343; Matter of L-S-, 22 I&N Dec. at 649;
Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. at 247; Matter of L-S-J-, 21 I&N Dec. at 974-75.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC
Considering the nature of the respondent's conviction and sentence, as well as the
circumstances and underlying facts of the offense, we conclude that his offense of recidivist DUI
with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or higher—while very serious—does not constitute a
particularly serious crime absent damage or immediate danger to persons or property. While
Delgado v. Holder, 648 F.3d 1095, 1107-08 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) implies that a recidivist DUI
conviction may be a particularly serious crime under some circumstances (a question we need not
decide), the respondent's conviction here is not for a particularly serious crime based on the
particular circumstances present in this case.
Moreover, the Immigration Judge's apparent reliance on the respondent's complete history of
contacts with the criminal justice system, including incidents that did not result in charges or
convictions, to assess whether an individual crime is particularly serious, is erroneous. Rather, the
focus of the analysis is on the “the nature of the conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and the
circumstances and underlying facts of the conviction.” Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 342
(emphasis added). The Immigration Judge's consideration of the respondent's contacts with the
criminal justice system would be appropriate in the context of a discretionary determination or an
assessment of good moral character under the catch-all provision set-forth in section 101(f) of the
Act, 8 U.S.C. $ 1101(f). However, it is not appropriate in the context of determining whether the
nature of the conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and the circumstances and underlying facts
of the conviction render it a particularly serious crime. We therefore conclude that the respondent
www.irac.net

We clarify that we are not holding that recidivism is an irrelevant consideration with respect to
determining whether a particular conviction constitutes a particularly serious crime. Rather, where,
as here, the recidivism was proven as an element of the offense, it is appropriately considered in
examining “the nature of the conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and the circumstances and

is not subject to the particularly serious crime bars to asylum and withholding of removal. See
sections 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act.? The record will be remanded to
determine whether the respondent otherwise qualifies for such relief.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the Immigration Judge's decision is vacated in part, and the
record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing
opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

underlying facts of the conviction.” Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. 247. However, in this case,
in considering the respondent's complete history of contacts with the criminal justice system over
many years, the Immigration Judge went well beyond considerations that can reasonably
illuminate the seriousness of the particular conviction at issue here (IJ at 3-4).

In light of this decision, we decline to consider the other arguments raised on appeal by the
respondent at this time.

ORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
The respondent is a single male, native and citizen of Mexico. The United
States Department of Homeland Security brought these removal proceedings against
the respondent under the authority of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Proceedings
were commenced with the filing of the Notice to Appear with the immigration court. See
Exhibit Number 1.
The respondent, through counsel, subsequently admitted all of the
Cite as: L-G-M-, AXXX XXX 348 (BIA Sept. 24, 2018)
.
allegations contained in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability as charged as
an alien present in the United States without having been properly admitted or paroled
into this country. Based on the respondents admissions and concessions the court
concludes that removability as charged has been established.
The respondent ultimately declined to designate a country of removal and
Mexico was directed by the court upon recommendation by the Department of
Homeland Security. The respondent applied for relief by filing an application form 1-589
and requesting asylum under Section 208(a) of the Act. Applications for asylum shall
also be considered as applications for withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of
the Act. The respondent also requests withholding or deferral of removal under the
United Nations Convention Against Torture. And then, finally, the respondent seeks
voluntary departure under Section 240B(b) of the Act in the alternative.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The respondent's form 1-589 application is contained in the record. Prior
to admission of the application the respondent was given an opportunity to make any
necessary corrections to the application and then swore or affirmed before this court
that the contents of the application were all true and correct to the best of his
knowledge.
The burden of proof is on the respondent to establish that he is eligible for
asylum or withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Act or relief under the
United Nations Convention Against Torture. The provisions of the REAL ID Act of 2005
apply to the respondent's application as it was filed on or after May 11, 2005.
In the respondent's case there is an initial threshold matter that he would
have to meet with respect to both his application for asylum and his applications for
withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Act as well as withholding of
removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and that issue is whether
348

Cite as: L-G-M-, AXXX XXX 348 (BIA Sept. 24, 2018)
..
the respondent has been convicted of a particularly serious crime
In Anaya-Ortiz v. Holder, 584 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 2010) the court of appeals
for the 9th Circuit dismissed a petition for review in a case were the administrative
review board had determined that an applicant who was convicted for driving under the
influence had been convicted of a particularly serious crime. Generally, in determining
whether a crime is particularly serious requires a case by case analysis using "such
factors as the nature of the conviction, the circumstances and underlying facts of the
conviction, the type of sentence imposed, and more importantly, whether the type and
circumstances of the crime indicate that the alien will be a danger to the community."
Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. 244 (BIA 1982) superseded by statute in part as
recognized in Miguel-Miguel v. Gonzalez, 500 F.3d 941 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Matter
of L-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 645 (BIA 1999), and Matter of NA-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336 (BIA
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
2007).
In Anaya-Ortiz, supra, the applicant had been convicted of driving under
the influence and in such condition ran into an elderly woman's home causing part of
the wall to collapse on her_substantial damage In reviewing the totality of the
circumstances the immigration judge concluded that respondent's crime was particularly
serious. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that determination and the court of
appeals dismissed the petition for review. In comparison, in this case the respondent
also had an incident where he was under the influence of alcohol and had a hit and run.
But fortunately for the respondent and for everyone he hit a parked car with no one
inside. So there was damage to a vehicle but no damage to a that person. And under
the circumstances he does not appear to have been convicted of DUI at that time, it was
hit and run. Although the respondent in his testimony here today admits not only that he
had consumed alcohol but that it did influence his driving. Perhaps one could say that
1348
3
June 14, 2017
Cite as: L-G-M-, AXXX XXX 348 (BIA Sept. 24, 2018)
,
the respondent was just lucky because although he had had prior warnings there was
no one in the car when he hit it.
This does not mean that the respondent has not been convicted of a
particularly serious crime because there is also case law which talks about the
cumulative accumulativeeffect affect of DUIs. And this is the case of Delgado v.
Holder, 648 F.3d 1095 (9th Cir. 2011) where the court of appeals for the 9th Circuit
stated that DUI convictions, when viewed cumulatively, may rise to the level of a
particularly serious crime. The court concludes that this is exactly the type of case
where a string of DUIs rises to the level, when viewed cumulatively, of being a
particularly serious crime. The record reflects that respondent had multiple encounters
with law enforcement, all of which either involved alcohol or resulted in convictions
where alcohol is actually an element. Here the respondent apparently had a domestic
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
violence arrest in 2001,
and although it did not lead to a conviction because the
respondent was subsequently turned over to the immigration authorities which resulted
in a voluntary return_he - He-admits that on this occasion he was drinking alcohol. And
when the respondent came back into the United States in 2005 he was arrested and
convicted for driving under the influence. Then in 2006 the respondent was arrested
and convicted for the hit and run mentioned earlier. His testimony includes that he was
under the influence and that influenced his driving at that time. In 2008 again the
respondent was again arrested and convicted for driving under the influence. In 2010
the respondent was arrested and convicted for driving under the influence. On
September 23, 2014, the respondent was arrested and convicted of driving on a
suspended license, which had been suspended because the respondent had a history
of driving under the influence. So clearly, the court would find that at least the
respondent's 2010 offense for driving under the influence where there were two prior
348
4
June 14, 2017
Cite as: L-G-M-, AXXX XXX 348 (BIA Sept. 24, 2018)
occasions of driving under the influence and two additional arrests where alcohol was
involved results under the cumulative assessment in Matter of Frentescu and Delgado
to be a particularly serious crime. Even then, the conduct didn't end because the
respondent had no business driving at all in 2014 when his license had been
suspended for his prior DUI conduct. So the court concludes under Matter of Frentescu
and also the court of appeals decision in Delgado v. Holder, supra, that the respondent
has been convicted of a particularly serious crime and therefore is statutorily barred
from asylum, withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the Act and withholding
of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.
The only application that the respondent has based on concern of return
to Mexico therefore is deferral of removal. To establish eligibility for deferral of removal
the respondent bears the burden of proving that it is more likely than not that he would
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
be tortured as defined in the regulations if removed to the proposed country of removal.
The torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or
acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
Acquiescence requires that the public official have prior awareness of the activity and
thereafter breech his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.
Here the respondent related two incidents where he suffered harm in
Mexico in the past but neither whether it rises to the level of past torture within the
definition of the regulations.
The respondent's concern upon return to his home country is summarized
1
in his application at Page 5, Part B, Number 1A, where he states, "I fear to return to my
country of birth. My family has suffered multiple attacks. In December of 2013 my
brother Salomon Contreras Maldonado was kidnapped and robbed by members of the
Zetas. He was threatened not to report this to the police. In March of 2015 criminals

:
broke into my daughter Esmeralda Gayoso's house in Veracruz, Mexico. They beat her
husband and son and threatened my daughter. They believed my son-in-law had
money because he's a taxi driver. In February of 2016 my stepson Jose Alphonso
Delacruz (phonetic) and his brother were beaten and robbed by gang members in early
a.m. hours."
Each of these incidents does not appear to be related to the other. All
appear to be based on motivation by criminals or a criminal group to kidnap or rob
various members of the respondent's family. However, for the respondent to say that it
is more likely than not that he will be tortured upon return is still speculative. Moreover,
the respondent has not addressed nor satisfied the requirement also of showing that the
torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of
a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. Again, acquiescence
requires that the public official have prior awareness of the activity and therefore breech
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity. The respondent
alleges here neither that the police or any other government authority instigated or
consented to the harm against his family members. But also that there is there's no
indication that the harm was reported to the police to give them an opportunity to
intervene to prevent such activity. The court concludes that the respondent's evidence
is insufficient to show deferral of removal under the United Nations Convention Against
Torture.
The respondent has asked for voluntary departure at the conclusion of
proceedings. He is not an arriving alien. The Notice to Appear does seem to have
been served more than one year after the respondent's last entry into the United States.
Although he has a string of DUI convictions they do not bar him statutorily on the face of
the numerical sections, Section 101(OF. However, there is a final sentence in Section
1348
6
June 14, 2017
Cite as: L-G-M-, AXXX XXX 348 (BIA Sept. 24, 2018)
101()F that refers to a accumulative assessment of negative factors and here the
respondent has a string of DUIs that constitutes a clear danger to the community. He
has alleged that he no longer drinks, but this string of arrests and convictions related to
alcohol span many years, much longer than the period in which the respondent states
1
he no longer has a problem with alcohol. Therefore, his conduct continues to represent
a specific danger to the community and either an inability or unwillingness to change his
behavior. The court would find that he has not shown good moral character under the
last sentence of 101(f)F for the purposes of voluntary departure. But even in the
alternative, assessing all of the elements of record, all of the factors, including the
presence of the respondent's son who has been granted DACA here in the United
States, the court would find that the respondent is not eligible for voluntary departure in
the exercise of discretion.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Again, starting with his DUI record, it's been noted that "No one can
seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the state's interest in
eradicating it. Media reports of alcohol related death and mutilation on the nation's road
are legion. The anecdotal is confirmed by the statistical drunk drivers causing annual
death toll of over 45,000. And in the same time span caused nearly 1 million personal
injuries and more than 5 billion dollars in property damage." This comes from a United
States Supreme Court decision in 1990. One can only estimate that the damage has
continued since the decision was issued and is no less dangerous than it was at the
time the Supreme Court uttered these words.
The record also reflects that the respondent not only has the string of
convictions here in the United States, but apparently also has been ushered out of the
United States on more than one occasion. He admits to “multiple” voluntary departure
in his application although he's not in a position to specify how many, clearly the
348
7

Cite as: L-G-M-, AXXX XXX 348 (BIA Sept. 24, 2018)
..
respondent has been made quite aware that he had no right to come back into the
United States. So not only is he presenting a danger to the community through his
alcohol related arrests, but he is also ignoring the clear indication that he had no right to
actually even be in the United States.
The court has considered the amount of time that the respondent has
been here, the presence of his son on DACA, but at the same time the respondent
appears to have no other strong family ties of a legal relationship. He speaks of having
a partner but is not currently married. And the respondent's son is an adult who may
receive some support from his father but is living in a separate room paying his own rent
and is well into his 20's. The court finds that the respondent's past history is not
overcome by the positive equities in the case. And that he has already had his second
chance to make good on a promise not to return to the United States after a voluntary
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
return, albeit administratively. The court concludes that on the assessment of all the
equities the respondent is not eligible for voluntary departure in the exercise of
discretion.
There is no other application before the court. The record will reflect that
there were was early discussions in the case as to whether the Department of
Homeland Security would entertain a request for prosecutorial discretion from the
respondent. The respondent was given time to pursue this, but ultimately the DHS
declined to extend prosecutorial discretion. Obviously, this is not a matter that is to be
decided by the court but the record should reflect that even on this circumstances time
was given to the respondent to look into the matter.
There being nothing further before this court the following orders are
entered:
