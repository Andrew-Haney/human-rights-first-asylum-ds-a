IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Michael G. Andegeorgis, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Michelle Allen-McCoy
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, has appealed from the Immigration Judge's
June 28, 2017, decision denying her application for asylum under section 208(b)(1) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1) (2012).' The Department of Homeland
Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be
remanded for any necessary background and security investigations.

The Board reviews an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including credibility
determinations and the likelihood of future events, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of Z-2-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues,
including questions of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent has been in ongoing removal proceedings since December 2010 (IJ at 1;
Exh. 1). On April 25, 2014, the Board dismissed the respondent's appeal of the Immigration
Judge's denial of her claim for asylum on account of her political opinion. On October 27, 2014,
the Board granted the respondent's motion to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum due to her
undergoing female genital mutilation. The Immigration Judge determined that the respondent was
not credible (IJ at 6-8). See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462, 464-65 (BIA 2002) (stating that the
Board must defer to the factual determinations of an Immigration Judge in the absence of clear
error). The Immigration Judge further determined that the respondent did not submit reasonably
available corroborating evidence sufficient to meet her burden to establish eligibility for asylum
(IJ at 8). See section 208(b)(1)(B) of the Act; Matter of L-A-C-, 26 I&N Dec. 516, 519 (BIA 2015)
(holding that regardless of whether a respondent is credible, he has the burden to corroborate the

| The Immigration Judge also denied withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act,
8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3) and protection under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.16(c)(2) (2018). The respondent has not meaningfully challenged these determinations on
appeal (see Notice of Appeal; Respondent's Br.). Hence, any challenge to the matters is deemed
waived. Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012); Matter of J-S-, 24 I&N
Dec. 520, 526 n.4 (A.G. 2008) (declining to address determinations not challenged on appeal).

material elements of his claim where the evidence is reasonably obtainable without advance notice
from the Immigration Judge).
Although there are discrepancies in the respondent's testimony and documentary evidence
related to the details of her experience with female genital mutilation (“FGM”), the respondent has
nevertheless submitted medical evidence that confirms she was subjected to such harm (see
IJ at 3-8; Exhs. 3, 11; Respondent's Motion to Reopen, Tab C). Additionally, although the
Immigration Judge rejected the doctor's clinical diagnosis because she did not submit a curriculum
vitae, the clinician was not providing an expert opinion – and such certification was not required
here (IJ at 8; Respondent's Br. at 6-7). Furthermore, in light of this evidence, statements from her
mother and sisters were not necessary to corroborate her claim of undergoing FGM (IJ at 8).
Therefore, we reverse the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent was not credible
and had not sufficiently corroborated her claim of past persecution on the basis of FGM.
As the respondent has established past persecution, she is entitled to a presumption that her life
or freedom would be threatened in the future upon her return to Ethiopia. See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1208.13(b)(1)(i). We acknowledge that the respondent testified that female genital mutilation
only happens one time for girls within the Gurage ethnic group – she would not be forced to
undergo it again – and the respondent did not fear any other harm due to her membership in the
Gurage ethnic group (IJ at 11-12). See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A), (B). As such, the
Immigration Judge properly determined that the DHS has satisfactorily rebutted the presumption
of any future harm (IJ at 8-12).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
However, under the circumstances presented here, we agree with the respondent that she is
eligible for asylum on a humanitarian basis (IJ at 13-14; Respondent's Br. at 7-10). As noted
above, the respondent has submitted medical evidence that she was subjected to FGM and she has
testified that she continues to experience mental suffering as a result of that experience (see
Tr. at 32, 41). Moreover, there are no discretionary grounds upon which to deny such relief.
Consequently, the respondent merits a grant of asylum on a humanitarian basis. See 8 C.F.R.
$ 1208.13(b)(1)(iii); Matter of L-S-, 25 I&N Dec. 705 (BIA 2012); Matter of S-A-K- and H-A-H-,
24 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 2008) (granting humanitarian asylum on the basis of the aggravated nature
of FGM performed on the respondents).
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent is eligible for asylum.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the DHS the opportunity to complete or update
identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations, and further proceedings, if
necessary, for the entry of an order as provided by 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.47(h).

File: A
1-210 - Dallas, TX

NOV 1 3 2018
In re: M
CONCURRING/DISSENTING OPINION: John P. Crossett, Temporary Board Member
I agree with the majority that the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility and corroboration
findings were erroneous and that the respondent has carried her burden to prove that she suffered
past persecution in Ethiopia in the form of female genital mutilation (“FGM”). This past
persecution entitles the respondent to a presumption that she has a well-founded fear of persecution
in Ethiopia on the same ground, see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1), but I also agree with the majority
that the presumption has been rebutted here because the respondent acknowledged that she is not
in jeopardy of experiencing future persecution—in the form of FGM or otherwise—in Ethiopia.
Where I part company with the majority is in their determination that the respondent qualifies
for "humanitarian asylum” on the present record, despite the absence of a well-founded fear of
future persecution, based on the severity of her past harm. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A);
accord Matter of S-A-K- & H-A-H-, 24 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 2008). I have no wish to minimize
the physical and emotional consequences of FGM, and I believe the respondent deserves a
compassionate hearing before the trier of fact on the question of her eligibility for humanitarian
asylum, based either on the severity of her past persecution or the possibility that she will suffer
"other serious harm” in Ethiopia. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii)(B).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
However, I disagree with the majority that the facts currently of record establish the
respondent's eligibility for humanitarian asylum as a matter of law. As the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has explained, “[f]or th[e humanitarian asylum) regulation to be
invoked, the past persecution suffered by an alien must be particularly severe, as was the case of
the German Jews, the victims of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, survivors of the Cambodian
genocide, and a few other such extreme cases. Shehu v. Gonzales, 443 F.3d 435, 440-41 & n.6
(5th Cir. 2006); see also Matter of Chen, 20 I&N Dec. 16, 19-21 (BIA 1989).
The gravity of past harm required for a grant of humanitarian asylum is vividly illustrated by
Matter of S-A-K- & H-A-H-, where this Board granted such protection to a mother and daughter
from Somalia who had experienced particularly aggravated forms of FGM and related harm:
The daughter in this case testified that she was forcibly circumcised by women
brought home by her father when she was 9 years old, in a procedure similar to that
suffered by her mother. The procedure was done without anesthesia and, although
she recovered after 2 weeks, she has continued to have difficulty urinating and has
been unable to menstruate. The aggravated nature of the procedure performed on
the daughter is also apparent in that, because her vaginal opening was sewn shut
with a thorn, the man she was given to in marriage, who ultimately raped her, could
not penetrate her for sexual intercourse. He was only able to rape her by cutting her
open, causing her to bleed for many days.

1-210
The mother, who is the lead respondent, likewise testified that she suffered great
pain following her forced circumcision, particularly during child birth, and that she
almost died during the actual procedure because of infection. During her earlier
pregnancies, her vaginal opening was sewn shut after being opened to allow for
sexual intercourse and child birth. She was sewn shut approximately five times, and
two of her children died during childbirth. Of her six daughters, the three oldest
have been circumcised, and she was beaten for opposing the procedure.
24 I&N Dec. at 465.
In granting humanitarian asylum to the present respondent, the majority notes only that she
was subjected to FGM and testified that she continues to experience mental suffering as a result.
I conclude that these facts alone are not sufficient to warrant a grant of humanitarian asylum, which
should be reserved for truly exceptional cases involving atrocious past persecution akin to that
described in Matter of S-A-K- & H-A-H-. Therefore, I would remand the record for a further
evidentiary hearing and for the entry of supplemental findings bearing on the nature and severity
of the respondent's past harm and the probability that she will suffer “other serious harm” if
removed to Ethiopia. Absent such findings, I believe the majority's decision is premature.
For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully concur in part but dissent from the majority's
determination that the respondent qualifies for asylum on the present record.
