IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Kevin M. Benedicto, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Ross Kurtz
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated April 19, 2019, denying her applications for asylum and withholding of removal
under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158,
1231(b)(3), and her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. The appeal will
be sustained.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review Immigration Judges' findings of fact for clear error, but questions of law, discretion,
and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo. 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (ii).
The respondent timely filed her asylum application, and the Immigration Judge determined
that she testified credibly (IJ at 4). The respondent is a transgender 23-year-old woman who is a
member of the Garifuna ethnic group and is HIV positive. She has suffered numerous types of
trauma throughout her life in Honduras. Such harms have included extortion and harassment by
police officers, an assault where she was cut with a knife and punched, severe discrimination by
her teacher and employers as well as society at large, and rape and domestic violence perpetrated
against her as a child. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent suffered harm rising to
the level of past persecution, on account of a protected ground under the Act (IJ at 6).
Moreover, we find clear error in the Immigration Judge's finding that the respondent did not
demonstrate that the harm she experienced was inflicted by persons that the govemment of
Honduras was unwilling or unable to control (IJ at 6-7). See Matter of V-T-S-, 21 I&N Dec. 792,
799 (BIA 1997). As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent did not report the abuses she
suffered to the police (IJ at 6; Tr. at 63, 69-70). However, we are persuaded by the respondent's
argument on appeal that voluminous country conditions evidence in the record, as well as her own
credible testimony regarding her experiences with the Honduran authorities, demonstrate that
.
The respondent is a transgender female who has adopted the name “Alexa.” We therefore use the
female pronoun to refer to her.

reporting would have been futile. See Resp. Brief at 11-16; Gonzalez-Veliz v. Barr, No. 18-60174,
2019 WL 4266121 (5th Cir. September 10, 2019) (noting that an alien must show that his or her
home government has “more than difficulty...controlling private behavior.").
Documentary evidence of record reflects that the government has made insufficient progress
to combat severe, pervasive violence inflicted against transgender women such as the respondent
(Exhs. 4,5). Moreover, transgender women continue to experience physical and sexual abuse, as
well as harassment, at the hands of police officers themselves (Exh. 4; Exh. 5 at Tab EE). This is
consistent with the respondent's testimony that she has personally been harassed and extorted by
Honduran police officers (Tr. at 64, 69; Exh. 4). Given these facts, we conclude that the respondent
sufficiently demonstrated that the persecution was inflicted by individuals that the government
was unwilling or unable to control. Matter of S-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 1328, 1335 (BIA 2000)
(concluding that an applicant suffered past persecution even if she did not report the persecution
to government authorities, where the evidence showed that if she turned to the goverment for
help, they would have been unable or unwilling to control the perpetrator's conduct).
In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the respondent has demonstrated that she suffered
past persecution on account of a protected ground, and that she therefore benefits from a
presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. See Matter of D-)-M, 24 I&N Dec. 448
(BIA 2008). Furthermore, the DHS did not sufficiently rebut the presumption under the facts
presented in this case, given the extensive country conditions evidence in the record. We also
conclude that the respondent merits a favorable exercise of discretion, and thus find her eligible
for asylum.? Therefore, we will sustain the respondent's appeal and remand the matter solely for
the required security checks.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded solely for the
required security checks.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
opportunity to complete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or
examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by
8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(h).
Bith helm
FOR THE BOARD
2 In light of our disposition of this matter, we need not address the Immigration Judge's denial of
the respondent's application for withholding of removal and her request for protection under the
Convention Against Torture.
