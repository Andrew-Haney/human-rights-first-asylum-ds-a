IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Albert S. Chow, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum
The respondent, a native and citizen of China, appeals from an Immigration Judge's decision
dated April 3, 2018, denying his application for asylum under section 208(b)(1)(A) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).' The Department of Homeland
Security has not filed a response to the appeal. The record will be remanded.
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

After the entry of the Immigration Judge's decision denying relief, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a decision with application to this matter. Specifically, in
Guo v. Sessions, 897 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir. 2018), the court found that a native and citizen of China
had experienced past persecution when he was arrested at a home church, detained for 2 days,
beaten to the point of bruises and minor injury, and forbidden from continuing to worship in the
home church. Guo v. Sessions, 897 F.3d at 1211-17. In light of this new casclaw, we conclude
that a remand is warranted for further fact-finding in this matter.
On remand, both sides should be permitted an opportunity to present additional relevant
evidence, and the Immigration Judge should issue a new order upon consideration of any new
evidence.
In remanding this record, we express no opinion as to the ultimate outcome on the respondent's
application for relief.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
| The respondent does not meaningfully challenge the denial of his withholding of removal and
Convention Against Torture claims, and thus, we deem these claims waived on appeal. See Matter
of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012) (failure to substantively appeal an issue
addressed in an Immigration Judge's decision renders that issue as waived on appeal).

ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.
