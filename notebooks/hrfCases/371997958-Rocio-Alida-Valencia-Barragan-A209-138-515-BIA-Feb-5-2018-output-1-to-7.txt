IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Sharon Arlene Healey, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondents, natives and citizens of Mexico, were ordered removed from the United States
in absentia on January 3, 2017, after not appearing at a hearing. They filed a motion to reopen on
February 8, 2017, and appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated June 5, 2017, denying
the motion. The appeal will be sustained.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo
standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1()(3)(ii).
:
In the Notice of Appeal (Form EOIR-26), the lead respondent, hereafter the respondent, argues
that she did not receive the Notice of Hearing. See Sembiring v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 981, 988–90
(9th Cir. 2007) (describing evidence sufficient to overcome presumption of effective service of
regular mail); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). She states that she diligently kept
her appointments with the Department of Homeland Security and timely filed an application for
asylum (Form I-589). The respondent also filed her motion to reopen with due diligence.
Moreover, it appears that the respondent had an incentive to appear at her hearing to pursue her
claim for asylum in the United States. In light of the foregoing, the respondents have rebutted the
presumption that the post office served them with the Notice of Hearing.
In addition, notwithstanding the above, the respondent established that her non-appearance at
the hearing was caused by an “exceptional circumstance.” See section 240(e)(1) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(e)(1) (stating that the term “exceptional
circumstances” refers to exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien
or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the
spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the
control of the alien). According to the respondent's declaration, she gave birth to her child via
caesarian section on December 24, 2016, and remained in the hospital until December 26, 2016.

A209 138 515 et a.
Hence, the respondent's medical condition appears to have rendered her unable to attend her
January 3, 2017, hearing. We will therefore reopen these proceedings.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order of removal is vacated, and these
proceedings are reopened and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing
opinion.

DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
I. Introduction and Procedural History
On October 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) initiated removal
proceedings against the Lead Respondent, Rocio Valencia Barragan, and her two minor children
by filing three Notices to Appear (“NTAs”) with the Seattle Immigration Court. Exh. 1. The
NTAs allege that the respondents are natives and citizens of Mexico, who applied for admission
to the United States at the San Luis Port of Entry on October 6, 2016, but did not then possess or
present a valid immigrant visa or entry document. Id. On the basis of these allegations, the DHS
charged the respondents as inadmissible under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (“INA”), as an intending immigrant without valid immigrant visas or entry
documents. Id. at 3.
1
Respondent and her children failed to appear at their initial master calendar hearing on
January 3, 2017. The Court granted DHS's motion to proceed in absentia. On the basis of the
facts asserted in the Form I-213, the Court found DHS had demonstrated by clear and convincing
evidence that the respondents were removable as charged in the NTAs and ordered them
removed to Mexico. Decision of the Immigration Court (Jan. 3, 2017). On February 8, 2017,
Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen and rescind the in absentia removal
orders. Respondent's Motion to Reopen and Rescind In Absentia Removal Order (Feb. 8, 2017)
(hereinafter “MTR”). DHS did not file an opposition brief. For the following reasons, the Court
denies Respondent’s motion to reopen.
II. Motion to Reopen
A. Notice
An in absentia removal order may be rescinded at any time if the alien demonstrates that
he did not receive notice. INA $240(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. 91003.23(b)(4)(ii). An alien is placed on
notice of proceedings if he receives the NTA. See Velasquez-Escovar v. Holder, 768 F.3d 1000,
1005 (9th Cir. 2014) (“[T]he NTA wams aliens that they will be removed in absentia if they fail
to appear.
."); Matter of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 188-89 (BIA 2001). Following proper
service of the NTA, a hearing notice, including a notice of change in time or place of
proceedings, may be served, in person or by mail, on the alien. See INA § 239(a)(2)(A).
However, no written notice is required “if the alien has failed to provide [his] address," as he is
required to do by the Act. INA $$ 239(a)(2)(B); 240(b)(5)(B); see also Velasquez-Escovar,
supra, at 1003-04. Specifically, an alien “must provide the Attorney General immediately with a
written record of any change of the alien's address or telephone number.” INA § 239(a)(1)(F)(ii).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Respondent concedes receipt of the NTAs, but claims she never received a notice of her
January 3, 2016 hearing. MTR at 2, 5. Additionally, the NTAs she was given did not specify a
time or date. See Exhs. 1, 1A, 1B. The respondent further claims that had she known about her
hearing she would have likely requested a continuance because she gave birth to her third child
on December 24, 2016. Id. at 5.
The Court applies a presumption of receipt to a hearing notice “sent by regular mail when
the notice was properly addressed and mailed according to normal office procedures,” but this
presumption is weaker than that accorded to notices sent by certified mail. Matter of M-R-A-, 24
I&N Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008). In determining whether the respondent has rebutted this
presumption of delivery, the Court must examine “all relevant evidence submitted,” and “may
consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to:" supporting affidavits, the alien's prior
attendance at hearings, whether the alien exercised due diligence upon leaming of the in absentia
order, any prior affirmative applications for relief indicating an incentive to appear, and any
other evidence of nonreceipt. Id. at 674.

For the following reasons, the Court finds notice was proper. DHS personally served
Respondent with the NTA after she presented herself at the border. The NTA expressly warned
Respondent that she “must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33
whenever (she) change[s] [her] address.” Exh. 1 at 2. During her initial interview with U.S.
Border Patrol agents, Respondent gave her aunt's home address at 1408 Ledwich Ave, Yakima,
Washington 98902 as her intended destination and residence. Exh. 3 at 2. On December 7, 2016,
the Seattle Immigration Court sent the January 3, 2017 hearing notice to the Yakima address
Respondent provided pursuant to normal office procedures. Exh. 2; INA 239(c). The hearing
notice was not retumed to the Court as undeliverable. Respondent did not provide any
explanation for why she did not receive the hearing notice. Rather, Respondent confirmed she
lived at the same address on record at the time the Court sent the hearing notice, but just did not
receive it. MTR at 5. The Court finds that Respondent has not rebutted the presumption of
delivery, given that her hearing notice was not returned as undeliverable and she did not proffer
any explanation for why she did not receive the hearing notice. See Matter of M-R-A-, supra, at
673. Thus, the Court denies Respondent's motion on this basis.
B. Sua Sponte Reopening to Apply for Asylum
Respondent did not clearly request the Court invoke its sua sponte authority. However,
"[a]n Immigration Judge may upon his or her own motion at any time ... reopen or reconsider
any case in which he or she has made a decision....”:8 C.F.R. $ 1003.23(b)(1). The decision to
grant or deny a motion to reopen ultimately lies within the discretion of the immigration judge.
Id. The power to reopen proceedings sua sponte is reserved for exceptional situations and “is not
meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or to otherwise circumvent the regulations,
where enforcing them might result in hardship.” Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA
1997). The Court has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has
established a prima facie case for relief. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Again, the Court finds that
Respondent has not presented exceptional circumstances that would warrant sua sponte
reopening.

i
The Court acknowledges Respondent alleges she came to the United States after fleeing
cartel violence and has three minor children, including one United States citizen child. See
generally MTR. Although Respondent claims she is eligible for relief from removal, the Court
finds that she is applying for discretionary relief in the form of asylum and the likelihood of
success remains speculative at best. See Sharma v. INS, 89 F.3d 545, (9th Cir. 1996) (finding no
exceptional circumstances where respondents arrived late for their hearing due to traffic
congestion and parking difficulties and their only possibility of relief from deportation was a
discretionary grant of asylum). Moreover, even accepting Respondent's affidavit as true, the
Court finds that she has not established prima facie eligibility for asylum. The Court agrees that
one's family constitutes a legally cognizable social group under Ninth Circuit precedent, but
A209-138-515
3
i
Respondent has not established her membership in that particular social group is one central
reason for any harm suffered in the past or feared in the future. See INA § 208(b)(1)(B)(i);
Flores-Rios v. Lynch, 807 F.3d 1123, 1128 (9th Cir. 2015) (recognizing “family” as "the
quintessential particular social group”). Rather, it appears the Knights Templar cartel targeted
her partner, not her, because he fought against the cartel as a member of a community militia
group. MTR at 24. While regrettable, the Court finds any risk of harm by the cartel against her
partner on account of his participation in the community militia would not qualify as harm on
account of a protected ground. See Madrigal v. Holder, 716 F.3d 499, 506 (9th Cir. 2013)
(“[M]istreatment motivated purely by personal retribution will not give rise to a valid asylum
claim."); see also Ayala v. Holder, 640 F.3d 1095, 1097-98 (9th Cir. 2011); Molina-Morales v.
INS, 237 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that harm as a result of a personal vendetta is
not persecution on account of a protected ground).
Accordingly, the following order will be entered:
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondents' motion to reopen is DENIED.
