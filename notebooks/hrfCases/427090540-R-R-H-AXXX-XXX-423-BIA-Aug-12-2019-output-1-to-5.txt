IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Nicholas W. Marchi, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Xiao Yan Huang
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum, withholding of removal, Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge's
October 23, 2017, decision denying his applications for asylum under section 208 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, and for withholding of removal under section
241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and pursuant to the Convention Against Torture. The
Department of Homeland Security ("DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed in
part and the record will be remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.

We review an Immigration Judge's factual determinations, including credibility
determinations, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board reviews de novo
questions of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of
Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The respondent's credibility is not at issue
on appeal (IJ at 3).
We first address the respondent's challenge to the Immigration Judge's denial of his
applications for asylum (including humanitarian asylum) and withholding of removal under the
Act. The respondent's claims to relief relate to his fear of harm from two sources: (1) a man who
kidnapped his mother from Mexico when he was around 1 year of age, in or around 1995; and
(2) his father, who neglected him while his mother was away and then physically abused him and
his mother (IJ at 4-9). The respondent claimed that he experienced past harm and feared future
harm on account of his membership in the particular social groups of (1) members of his mother's
family, and (2) victims of domestic violence who are members of the same family (IJ at 6).
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's claims to asylum and withholding of removal
because, even if the man who kidnapped his mother threatened the respondent due to his family
relationship to her, the record did not contain adequate evidence to reflect that this man still sought
to harm the respondent on this or any basis (IJ at 7). We affirm this finding, i.e., that the record
does not reflect the requisite evidence to support a well-founded fear of future persecution, as
lacking clear error. See IJ at 7-8 (noting the passage of time, the lack of evidence reflecting the
kidnapper's whereabouts, and the lack of evidence reflecting that the kidnapper had any further
Cite as: R-R-H-, AXXX XXX 423 (BIA Aug. 12, 2019)
-423
contact with the respondent or his relatives).' Furthermore, while the respondent claims to have
suffered domestic violence in the United States at the hands of his father (who is now dead), we
affirm the finding that the record does not contain evidence to show that Mexican society would
recognize as a particular social group those members of the respondent's family who were subject
to domestic abuse in the United States (IJ at 8-9).
We turn next to the respondent's appeal from the denial of humanitarian asylum. This relief
was denied by the Immigration Judge because, first, the respondent did not show that his domestic
abuse by his father was on account of a protected ground, cf. Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316
(A.G. 2018), and second, he did not suffer egregious harm at the hands of the kidnapper, even
assuming that he was threatened by that man due to his family relationship to his mother. See IJ
at 9. On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge's denial of humanitarian asylum
was in error because the Immigration Judge found that he had experienced past persecution based
on the threats from the kidnapper, but then failed to determine whether humanitarian asylum was
proper due to “other serious harm” that the respondent would encounter in Mexico. Cf.
Respondent's Br. at 19-21. We note that insofar as the Immigration Judge stated that the
respondent experienced past persecution (IJ at 9), further analysis of the record should have been
conducted to determine whether a grant of humanitarian asylum is appropriate under the “other
serious harm” prong of 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii). On remand, the Immigration Judge should
undertake this analysis, if appropriate and if the Immigration Judge determines that the threat that
rose to the level of persecution was on account of a protected ground.2

We affirm the Immigration Judge's decision that the respondent has not established that anyone
in Mexico would, more likely than not, torture him with the consent or acquiescence of the
goverment (including the concept of willful blindness) (IJ at 9). The Immigration Judge found
without clear error that the respondent's father was dead and that he had no objective evidence that
the man who kidnapped his mother sought to harm him (IJ at 3-9). As such, the record lacks
sufficient evidence to support a claim that he faces a clear probability of torture. See Ridore
v. Holder, 696 F.3d 907, 922 (9th Cir. 2012).
Contrary to the respondent's argument on appeal, Respondent's Br. at 12-19, we read the
Immigration Judge's determination in this regard to find that any presumption in favor of future
persecution that arose due to the threats against the respondent from the kidnapper (assuming the
requisite nexus) has been rebutted by evidence of record, including evidence elicited by the DHS
on cross-examination of the respondent, reflecting no further contact from this man, including in
the years immediately after this man allegedly returned to Mexico (IJ at 7-9; Tr. at 52-58).
2 We note that the record is unclear on this point, as the Immigration Judge stated (in reference to
the threats by the kidnapper) that the respondent was “persecuted in the past” but also stated that
this harm was not “on account of any particular basis.” See IJ at 9. Moreover, we note that the
Attomey General's recent decision in Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 581 (A.G. 2019), calls into
question the cognizability of the respondent's proposed particular social groups based on family
membership. On remand, the Immigration Judge should reconsider this issue to the extent
necessary.

We are unpersuaded by the respondent's appellate arguments that the Immigration Judge erred
in denying his request to present the telephonic testimony of an expert witness and his mother.
Respondent's Br. at 6-8. Since the Immigration Judge ultimately allowed the statements of these
witnesses into the record, and because the respondent does not specifically identify any evidence
that was excluded as a result of the Immigration Judge's decision, we reject the argument that the
ruling as to witnesses constituted a prejudicial due process violation. See Vides-Vides v. INS, 783
F.2d 1463, 1469-70 (9th Cir. 1986) (an alien must demonstrate prejudice in order to establish a
due process violation); Nicholas v. INS, 590 F.2d 802, 809-10 (9th Cir. 1979) (“The alien has been
denied the full and fair hearing which due process provides only if the thing complained of causes
the alien to suffer some prejudice.").
In addition to challenging the denial of his applications for relief, the respondent argues on
appeal that he should have been granted a continuance to allow for adjudication of his pending
U visa petition pursuant to Matter of Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. 807 (BIA 2012). See
Respondent's Brief at 9-10. During the hearing, the Immigration Judge stated that he would deny
the continuance because the respondent had recently been released from detention on bond and his
case was therefore a priority (Tr. at 10-18), and his written decision indicates that the continuance
was denied solely for this reason (IJ at 2).
The respondent's application for a U visa was filed in January 2017 (Exh. 9). The record
reflects that he has secured a law enforcement certification which is a necessary prerequisite to
approval of that visa (Id.). Although U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has exclusive
jurisdiction over the respondent's U visa application, a continuance to await the adjudication of a
pending U visa application may still be appropriate under certain circumstances. See Matter of
Sanchez Sosa, 25 I&N Dec. at 812-15 (outlining when and under what circumstances a
continuance may be supported by good cause to await the adjudication of a pending U visa
application); 8 C.F.R. 98 1003.29 and 1240.6.

Recently, in Matter of L-A-B-R-, et al., 27 I&N Dec. 405, 406 (A.G. 2018), the Attorney
General discussed the proper application of the good-cause standard to a motion for continuance
to accommodate collateral proceedings.” The Attorney General stated that an Immigration Judge
is to “consider() primarily the likelihood that the collateral relief will be granted and will materially
affect the outcome of the removal proceedings, and any other relevant secondary factors.” Id. at
419; see also id. at 416-17 (discussing previous precedent disapproving denial of continuances
where administrative “case-completion goals” are the sole basis for such decision).
Matter of L-A-B-R- does not alter the fundamental considerations outlined in Malter of Sanchez
Sosa that bear on whether proceedings should be continued where an alien presents evidence that
an application for relief is pending in a collateral proceeding or with another agency. The record
reflects that the Immigration Judge did not consider the likelihood that the respondent's application
for a U visa would be successful, assess whether it would materially affect the outcome of these
proceedings, or inquire as to whether the Department of Homeland Security opposed any
continuance. Given these circumstances, we will remand this record for the Immigration Judge to
make these determinations and to reconsider whether proceedings should be continued pending
the adjudication of the respondent's U visa application.

Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal from the denial of his applications for withholding of
removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture is dismissed.
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge should address whether the respondent is
entitled to humanitarian asylum under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii) because he will suffer “other
serious harm” upon return to Mexico.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for additional further proceedings consistent
with this order.
