IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Rachel Yamamoto, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Joshua P. Sleper
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Reopening
This case was last before us on August 7, 2018, at which time we dismissed the respondent's
appeal from the Immigration Judge's March 1, 2018, denial of his requests for asylum and
withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
8 U.S.C. $$ 1158 and 1231(b)(3), his application for protection under the Convention Against
Torture, and his request for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Sections 244(c)(1), (2) of the Act;
8 C.F.R. 88 244.2, 1244.2 (2011); see also Designation of El Salvador Under Temporary Protected
Status Program, 66 Fed. Reg. 14,214 (Mar. 9, 2001). The respondent has now filed a timely
motion to reopen proceedings on August 14, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security
opposes the motion, which will be granted.

A motion to reopen shall not be granted unless it appears that the evidence sought to be offered
“was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.” See
8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1). Further, this Board has held that a party who seeks to reopen proceedings
to pursue a discretionary grant of relief from removal bears a "heavy burden" of demonstrating
that if his motion to reopen were granted, the new evidence presented would likely change the
result in the case. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464 (BIA 1992).
The Immigration Judge found the respondent ineligible for asylum and TPS based on “serious
reasons to believe that the respondent committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside of the United
States” and the respondent's failure to satisfy his burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that the serious nonpolitical crime bar does not apply (IJ at 11-13). The Immigration
Judge's finding was based, inter alia, on an INTERPOL Red Notice, indicating that the respondent
had been charged in El Salvador with Illicit Groupings under article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal
Code (Exh. 3, at 8; Exh. 8 at 2; Exh. 11).
An individual is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal where there are serious
reasons for believing that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United
States.” See section 208(b)(2)(A)(iii) (asylum), 241(b)(3)(B)(iii) (withholding of removal);
244(c)(2)(B)(ii) (TPS). The Board has interpreted “serious reasons for believing" as tantamount
to probable cause. See Matter of E-A-, 26 I&N Dec. 1, 3 (BIA 2012).

A
1-488
In support of his motion, the respondent has submitted new, previously unavailable evidence,
including a notice from the San Salvador Integrated Criminal Justice Center, indicating that
charges against the respondent have been definitively dismissed. In response, the DHS argues
that, notwithstanding the respondent's evidence, serious reasons still exist to believe that the
respondent has committed the crime, because the evidence of record indicates that the respondent's
criminal proceedings were dismissed primarily because the prosecution's witness died (Tr. at 125-
127; Exh. 8).
We note that the record before the Immigration Judge contained a letter from the respondent's
Salvadoran attorney, indicating that the respondent's criminal case was subject to provisional
dismissal, and describing the circumstances surrounding the Salvadoran goverment's decision
not to continue the prosecution of the respondent (Exh. 8). The letter from the respondent's
Salvadoran attorney also explained that the court was unable to definitively dismiss the
respondent's case until he appears in court. Given this evidence, the Immigration Judge ultimately
found that “as long as this charge is still pending ... and the United States remains a signatory to
INTERPOL, because it is a red notice, “the respondent (could not] establish by the preponderance
of the evidence that he is not subject to the bar].”
Under the circumstances, we find that the respondent's newly proffered evidence materially
counters the Immigration Judge's reliance on the INTERPOL Red Notice to demonstrate that there
are “serious reasons to believe” the respondent has committed a serious nonpolitical crime,
especially given the respondent's Salvadoran attorney's previous indication that the criminal
proceedings had been provisionally dismissed. Therefore, we find that the respondent has carried
the "heavy burden" for reopening, and we will remand the record to the Immigration Court for
further proceedings regarding the respondent's eligibility for relief from removal. Matter of
Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. at 473. As such, the following order will be entered.

ORDER: The motion is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Court for
further proceedings consistent with the foregoing decision.
