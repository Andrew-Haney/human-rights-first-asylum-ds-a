APPEAL

ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Suchita D. Mathur, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Rebecca Patricia McGee
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture
The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) appeals the July 3, 2019, decision of the
Immigration Judge granting the applicant's request for deferral of removal under the Convention
Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. 98 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The applicant, a native and citizen of the
Dominican Republic, opposes the appeal. The appeal will be dismissed. The record will be
remanded to the Immigration Judge for any necessary background and security investigations.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de
novo. 8 C.F.R. & 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On appeal, the DHS challenges the Immigration Judge's predictive factual findings forecasting
the likelihood that the applicant would be tortured upon return to the Dominican Republic and that
Dominican goverment officials would be willfully blind or otherwise acquiesce to such action
(DHS Br. at 11, 13-15). In addition, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge's findings are a
series of unsupported suppositions, and thus, the Immigration Judge's decision is not in accordance
with the Attorney General's decision in Maller of J-F-F., 23 I&N Dec. 912 (A.G. 2006)
(DHS Br. at 12, 16).
We adopt and affirm the Immigration Judge's decision. See Matter of Burbano, 20 I&N Dec.
872, 874 (BIA 1994). The Immigration Judge made factual findings based on the evidence of
record that are without clear error. See United States v. Nat'l Assn. of Real Estate Bds., 339 U.S.
485, 495 (1950) (a factual finding is not "clearly erroneous” merely because there are two
permissible views of the evidence).'
The DHS does not specifically challenge the Immigration Judge's positive credibility findings
with respect to the applicant, his mother, and his expert witness, which are not clearly erroneous
(IJ at 7-9; see DHS Br. at 3, 16).

While the DHS disagrees with the Immigration Judge's predictive factual findings forecasting
the likelihood that the applicant would be tortured upon return to the Dominican Republic and that
Dominican government officials would be willfully blind or otherwise acquiesce to such action,
given that our standard of review is “clear error,” we must affirm the Immigration Judge's factual
findings as long as they are based on a permissible view of the evidence, even if we would have
made different factual findings had we been the Immigration Judge. See Matter of 2-2-0-, 26 I&N
Dec. 586, 591 (BIA 2015) (stating that an Immigration Judge's predictive findings of what may or
may not occur in the future are findings of fact, which are subject to a clearly erroneous standard
of review); Malter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 341 (A.G. 2018) (explaining that the Board may
only find clear error where the findings of fact “are illogical or implausible,” or without “support
in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record” (internal citation omitted)); see also
Matter of D-R-, 25 I&N Dec. 445, 455 (BIA 2011) explaining that “[a]n Immigration Judge may
make reasonable inferences from direct and circumstantial evidence in the record as a whole and
is not required to accept a respondent's account where other plausible views of the evidence are
supported by the record.”). Based on this deferential standard, we discern no clear error in the
Immigration Judge's finding that the applicant would more likely than not be tortured in the future
"by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person
acting in an official capacity,” in the Dominican Republic (IJ at 11-16). 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), 1208.18(a)(1); Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260, 263 (BIA 2007) (citing
United States v. Nat'l Ass 'n of Real Estate Bds., 339 U.S. at 495 (explaining that a factual finding
is not “clearly erroneous” merely because there are two permissible views of the evidence)).
The applicant's application is based on his claim that he has been an informant on numerous
criminal investigations in the United States, which involved individuals based in the
Dominican Republic; that the applicant has been threatened in the United States because of his
extensive work with the United States government; that his family members have been threatened
in the United States and the Dominican Republic because of his extensive work with the
United States government, and that the authorities in the Dominican Republic will be willfully
blind or otherwise acquiesce to harm amounting to torture that he would face upon return to the
Dominican Republic.

The DHS does not identify clear error in the Immigration Judge's findings, but instead argues
for a different interpretation of the evidence that is reasonable, but is not compelled by the evidence
(DHS Br. at 10-16). The Immigration Judge supported his detailed findings as to each step in his
analysis with extensive citations to, and discussions of, the background evidence of record,
including the credible testimony of the applicant and Mr. A a Drug Enforcement
Administration agent, and the Immigration Judge's findings constitute a permissible view of the
evidence as a whole (IJ at 11-16). United States v. Nat'l Ass 'n of Real Estate Bds., 339 U.S. at 495.
Thus, we cannot reverse them.
The DHS asserts that the Immigration Judge erred in relying on dicta from De La Rosa
v. Holder, 598 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 2010) in his analysis of acquiescence (DHS Br. at 13).
We disagree. In that case, the court noted the Immigration Judge had “made a series of factual
findings bearing on the actual involvement of Dominican government actors in the possible killing
of De La Rosa.” Id. at 109. In the present case, the Immigration Judge's factual findings relate to

evidence in the record of goverment officials who would more likely than not torture the applicant
(IJ at 15).
Given the factual predictions of what will likely happen to the applicant upon his retum to the
Dominican Republic, and by whom, which we have determined are not clearly erroneous, we agree
with the Immigration Judge that the harm the applicant would likely suffer meets the legal
definition of torture (IJ at 11-16). See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(a)(1). In this respect, we note that
although the DHS challenges the Immigration Judge's factual predictions of future events, the
DHS does not contend that the harm predicted by the Immigration Judge does not meet the legal
definition of torture (DHS Br. at 11-16). See id. The DHS essentially argues that the Immigration
Judge impermissibly made inferences based on the testimony and evidence (Id.). See United States
v. Nat'l Ass 'n of Real Estate Bds., 339 U.S. at 495.
However, based on the evidence of record, the DHS has not established that the
Immigration Judge's findings that it is more likely than not that the applicant will be tortured, and
that Dominican goverment officials will be willfully blind or otherwise acquiesce to such action,
are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (d)(3)(i); Matter of J-F-F-, 23 I&N Dec. at 917.
We will remand the record of proceedings for completion of the required background checks.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The DHS's appeal is dismissed.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the DHS the opportunity to complete or update
identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations, and further proceedings, if
necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.47(h).
