In re: ENNIO EDGARDO GALVEZ
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Alex Holguin, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated March 14, 2016. We review questions of law, discretion, and judgment arising in
appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges de novo, whereas we review findings of fact in such
appeals under a "clearly erroneous” standard. See 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3). The record will be
remanded.
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's March 4, 2016, motion to reopen his removal
proceedings after the issuance of an in absentia order of removal on August 24, 2010. Pursuant to
section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(C), an in
absentia removal order may be rescinded only (1) upon a motion to reopen filed within 180 days
after the date of the order of removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because
of exceptional circumstances, or (2) upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien
demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice of the hearing in accordance with sections
239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act, or that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear
through no fault of the alien. Sections 240(b)(5)(C)(i) and (ii) of the Act; see also Matter of
Guzman, 22 I&N Dec. 722, 722-23 (BIA 1999). The respondent's motion did not establish any of
these circumstances. The motion acknowledged that it was too late to establish extraordinary
circumstances and included no affidavit by the respondent or other evidence to establish that he did
not receive notice of his missed hearing. We therefore agree with the Immigration Judge that the
respondent's motion did not meet the statutory grounds for rescission of his order of removal under
section 240(b)(5)(C) of the Act.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
However, on appeal the respondent has submitted evidence that tends to show that he no longer
lived at the address to which his Notice to Appear (Exh. 1) and Notice of Hearing were sent. Given
this evidence, we find it appropriate to remand the record to allow the Immigration Judge to conduct
fact-finding, by holding a hearing if necessary, to determine whether the respondent received notice
of the August 24, 2010, hearing in accordance with sections 239(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. See Matter
of G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 181 (BIA 2001).
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.

DECISION AND ORDER OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
I.
Procedural History
Ennio Edgardo Galves (Respondent) is a native and citizen of El Salvador. Exh. 1. On
May 12, 2010, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (the Department) served Respondent
with a Notice to Appear (NTA) by mail. Id. In the NTA, the Department alleged that
Respondent was admitted to the United States on July 20, 2000, as a nonimmigrant B2 visitor
with authorization to remain the United States for a limited period of stay, and has remained in
the United States since without authorization. Id. Accordingly, the Department charged
Respondent with removability pursuant to section 237(a)(1)(B) of the INA. Id. Jurisdiction
vested and removal proceedings commenced when the Department filed the NTA with the Court
on May 24, 2010. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14 (2010).
On June 10, 2010, the Court mailed Respondent a notice of hearing (NOH) for his
August 24, 2010 hearing to the address provide3d on the NTA. Respondent failed to appear for
his August 24, 2010 hearing. Accordingly, the Court, proceeding in absentia, found that the
Department established removability through clear and convincing evidence and ordered
Respondent removed to El Salvador.
On March 4, 2016, Respondent filed the pending motion to reopen his proceedings and to
rescind the order of removal entered against him in absentia on August 24, 2010. On March 10,
2016, the Department filed an opposition to Respondent's motion.
For the following reasons, the Court denies Respondent's motion to reopen.
II.
Law, Analysis, and Findings of the Court
A.
Timeliness
An in absentia order of removal may be rescinded if a motion to reopen is filed within
180 days after the final order of removal if the respondent can show that the failure to appear was
due to exceptional circumstances or at any time if the respondent demonstrates that he did not
receive proper notice. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). For the purposes of
calculating motion deadlines, the date that an immigration judge's order is entered fixes the
deadline for filing a motion to reopen. Matter of Goolcharan, 23 I&N Dec. 5, 6 (BIA 2001).
In the present case, the Court issued an in absentia order removing Respondent and
concluding his proceedings on August 24, 2010. Respondent did not file the pending Motion
until March 6, 2016, over five years after his hearing. Therefore, Respondent's Motion is
untimely
B.
Notice
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Court may rescind an in absentia removal order upon a motion to reopen filed at any
time if the respondent demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice. INA
$ 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); see also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). A respondent receives proper notice of
a proceeding if written notice is given to him in person or sent by mail at the most recent address
the respondent provided. See INA § 239(a)(1), (2); Matter of G-Y-R, 23 I&N Dec. 181, 185
(BIA 2001). It is not always necessary that a respondent receive actual notice of the proceeding.
See G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. at 189. Service by mail is sufficient if there is proof of attempted
delivery to the last address provided by the respondent as required under section 239(a)(1)(F) of
the INA. INA § 239(c). A respondent can be properly charged with receiving constructive
notice, even though he did not personally see the mailed document, if he was informed of his
obligation to keep the Court apprised of his address and the NOH is mailed to the last known
address of record. G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. at 189. The respondent bears the burden of supporting
the motion with specific, detailed evidence to corroborate his claim. See Celis-Castellano v.
Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 888, 890 (9th Cir. 2002).
In the present matter, Respondent does not allege that he missed his hearing due to lack
of notice. Specifically, counsel for Respondent stated that he was “unable to ascertain whether
Responded failed to receive notice of his last scheduled hearing.” Resp’t’s Mot. at 3.
Additionally, both the NTA and the NOH were sent to Respondent's address of record, and there
was no evidence provided to show ineffective delivery. Salta v. INS, 314 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th
Cir. 2003) (To overcome the presumption of delivery, a respondent must submit sufficient
evidence to support her claim that she did not receive notice.)
2
Overall, Respondent failed to meet his evidentiary burden. See Celis-Castellano,
298 F.3d at 890, M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 674. As a result, the Court finds that Respondent
received notice of his scheduled hearing and denies his motion on that basis. INA
§ 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); G-Y-R-, 23 I&N Dec. at 189; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
C.
Changed Country Conditions
A respondent may request the Court reopen proceedings at any time to apply or reapply
for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT, if such claim is based on
changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality, and if such evidence is material
and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Malty v. Ashcroft, 381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir. 2004);
Azanor v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 1013, 1021-1022 (9th Cir. 2004). In determining the sufficiency of
changed country conditions, the “critical question” is “whether circumstances have changed
sufficiently that a (respondent] who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now
has a well-founded fear of future persecution.” Malty, 381 F.3d at 945. In making this
assessment, the Court will compare the evidence of country conditions submitted with the
motion, to those that existed at the time of the last merits hearing. Matter of S-Y-G-, 24 I&N
Dec. 247, 253 (BIA 2007).
Respondent claims that he fears retum to El Salvador because of his sexuality and his
diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). While the Court is sympathetic to the
issues Respondent may face, he made no mention of a change of conditions in El Salvador since
his last hearing. Additionally, he failed to produce any evidence that was undiscoverable or
unavailable at the time of his last hearing. As a result, the Court concludes that Respondent has
failed to demonstrate changed country conditions in El Salvador sufficient to warrant the
reopening of his proceedings.

D.
Sua Sponte
Respondent also requests the Court reopen under its sua sponte authority. An
immigration judge may, upon her own motion at any time, or upon motion of the Department or
the alien, reopen any case in which she has made a decision. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1). The
decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen is within the discretion of the immigration judge. 8
C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1)(iv). The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) has stated that “the
power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects or
to otherwise circumvent the regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship.” Matter
of J-J-, 21 I&N Dec. 976, 984 (BIA 1997). Proceedings should be reopened sua sponte only in
“exceptional” situations. Id. Moreover, the Board has indicated that where finality is a key
objective, the threshold for sua sponte reopening is extremely high. See Matter of O-, 19 I&N
Dec. 871, 871 (BIA 1989).
A motion to reopen must state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if
the motion is granted. INA § 240(c)(6)(B); 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.23(b)(3). Additionally, where the
alien seeks to reopen proceedings to act on an application for relief, he must establish prima
facie eligibility for the relief sought by showing that there is a reasonable likelihood of success
on the merits so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues further at an individual hearing.
3
See INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 449 (1985); Delgado-Ortiz v. Holder, 600 F.3d 1148,
1151 (9th Cir. 2010); Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413, 419 (BIA 1996).
In the present matter, Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief in the form of
adjustment of status and asylum. Yet, he did not submit a Form-I 589, Application for Asylum
and Withholding of Removal, with his motion. Even assuming Respondent can demonstrate
prima facie eligibility for such relief, the Court may still deny the motion to reopen in the
exercise of discretion. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. at 449; Matter of Reyes, 18 I&N Dec. 249, 252
(BIA 1982). Overall, the equities in Respondent's case do not merit granting his motion sua
sponte. Respondent has not demonstrated due diligence in filing the present motion to reopen.
The Court order Respondent removed to El Salvador in August 2010, yet he waited over five
years to file this motion. Further, he missed his only hearing with the Court, and thus, he has not
demonstrated that he is committed to pursuing his case with this Court. The Court acknowledges
that Respondent married a United States citizen in 2013; however, reopening sua sponte based
on equities acquired after the entry of a final removal order would undermine the INA and
circumvent the regulations. See INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 450-51 (1985). Based on the
foregoing, and in the interest of finality, the Court will not reopen Respondent's case sua sponte.
Accordingly, the Court shall enter the following order:
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondents' motion to reopen be DENIED.
