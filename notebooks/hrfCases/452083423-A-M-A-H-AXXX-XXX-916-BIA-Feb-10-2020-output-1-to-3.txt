IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS
MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Nataly E. Cabrera, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
This matter was last before the Board on December 12, 1991, when we summarily dismissed
the respondent's appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated July 29, 1991, denying her
application for asylum and withholding of deportation but granting voluntary departure with an
alternate order of deportation to El Salvador.' The respondent, a native and citizen of El Salvador,
has filed the instant motion to reopen deportation proceedings to apply for adjustment of status.
The record before us does not contain a reply to the motion from the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS). The motion will be granted.

On July 5, 2019, the respondent filed a motion to reopen proceedings to afford her the
opportunity to apply for adjustment of status based on an approved I-360 self-petition as a battered
spouse of a lawful permanent resident (Respondent's Motion at 2-6). See section 204(a)(1)(B)(ii)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(B)(ii). The respondent's motion is
exempt from the time limitations on motions to reopen. See section 240 of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1229a, Note 1 (no time limitations on motions to reopen deportation proceedings for suspension
of deportation or adjustment of status based on a Violence Against Women and Department of
Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (VAWA) self-petition).
The documentary evidence submitted in support of this motion includes a notice dated
March 26, 2015, approving an 1-360 petition for Amerasian, widower or special immigrant, a
completed I-485 application to register permanent residence or adjust status, and an I-864W
request for exemption for intending immigrant's affidavit of support, along with other supportive
documentation (Respondent Motion, Tabs C-H). Moreover, because the respondent is seeking
adjustment of status based on an approved petition for classification as a VAWA self-petitioner,
she is not required to demonstrate that she was inspected and admitted or paroled into the United
States to establish her eligibility for adjustment of status under section 245(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1255(a). This evidence establishes the respondent's prima facie eligibility for a form of relief
that was not previously available to her at the time of her proceedings before the Immigration
Judge. See section 240(c)(7) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. 1003.2(c)(1); INS
V. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988); see also Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 413 (BIA 1996).

Given the respondent's apparent eligibility for special immigrant status and adjustment of
status, as well as the lack of any affirmative opposition to the motion from the-DHS-the timely...
motion to reopen will be granted to permit the respondent to present her claim and for the
Immigration Judge to take any action deemed appropriate concerning the respondent's application
for adjustment of status. Cf. Matter of Velarde, 23 I&N Dec. 253 (BIA 2002); see also
Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 471-72 (BIA 1992).
As the record will be remanded, we do not reach the respondent's remaining arguments
(Respondent's Motion at 4-6). In remanding, we express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of
these proceedings. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The motion to reopen is granted, and the record is remanded to the Immigration
Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the issuance of a new
decision.
