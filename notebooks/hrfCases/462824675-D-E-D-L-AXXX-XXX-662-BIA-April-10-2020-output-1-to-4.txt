In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Lara Nochomovitz, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Dustin T. Roth
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Nicaragua, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated August 21, 2019, denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal
pursuant to sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A), as well as his request for protection under the
Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. S$ 1208.1(c), 1208.18. The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained and the record will be remanded.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the "clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent claimed that he suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of
persecution in Nicaragua on account of his political opinion (IJ at 1, 11-12; Respondent’s Br. at
2-3, 7; Exhs. 3, 8).' Specifically, the respondent testified that he participated in a number of
marches and protests in Nicaragua, beginning in April 2018, in response to the Nicaraguan
President's announcement of unpopular social security reforms (IJ at 3; Tr. at 73). During these
protests, the police and paramilitary forces shot at the participants, killing some and injuring others
(IJ at 3-4; Tr. at 76-78, 80-81). After one such protest, the respondent encountered police and
paramilitary forces, who allegedly took the respondent's picture and then beat the respondent with
their guns until the respondent lost consciousness (IJ at 4; Tr. at 86, 90-94, 143). The respondent

| We note that the respondent also indicated he was seeking asylum and related forms of protection
from removal based on his membership in a particular social group (IJ at 11; Exhs. 3, 8). However,
the Immigration Judge noted that the respondent did not proffer any particular social group to
which he might belong, and therefore, we agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent
did not meet his burden to demonstrate his membership in a cognizable particular social group
(IJ at 11). Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014); see also Matter of W-Y-C- &
H-O-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 189, 191 (BIA 2018) (emphasizing the importance of articulating the
contours of any proposed particular social group before the Immigration Judge).

indicated that he suffered injuries to his hand and to his head as a result of this beating (IJ at 4; Tr.
at 91-94). The respondent believes that if he were to return to Nicaragua, then he would be arrested
and persecuted or tortured for his participation in these protests (Tr. at 96-99; Respondent's Br. at
7; Exhs. 3, 8).
The Immigration Judge found the testimony of the respondent and his witnesses to be credible
(IJ at 9). However, the Immigration Judge determined that the respondent had not established that
he held a political opinion, and thus, he determined that the respondent was unable to demonstrate
a nexus between his political opinion and any harm the respondent suffered in the past or fears in
the future in Nicaragua (IJ at 11-13). Based on this finding, the Immigration Judge denied the
respondent's applications for asylum and withholding of removal (IJ at 11-13).
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge's analysis of his asylum claim is
flawed (Respondent's Br. at 2-7). We agree. Regardless of whether the respondent holds an actual
political opinion, he may establish his eligibility for relief from removal by demonstrating that his
persecutors imputed a political opinion to him and harmed him on account of or because of such
imputed political opinion. See Haider 1. Holder, 595 F.3d 276, 284-85 (6th Cir. 2010)
(reaffirming that a respondent may establish his eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal
by virtue of his imputed political opinion). Further, a respondent need only provide some
evidence-either direct or circumstantial—that his persecutors imputed a political opinion to him
and harmed him because of it. Bu 1 Gonzales, 490 F.3d 424, 430 (6th Cir. 2007) (citation
omitted).

Here, the Immigration Judge did not analyze the evidence of record—including the credible
testimony that the respondent was a participant in marches and protests against Nicaraguan
government policy—to determine whether the respondent sufficiently established that his
persecutors imputed a political opinion to him (IJ at 11-13; Tr. at 73, 76-81, 90-94, 143;
Respondent’s Br. at 2-7). Id. Additionally, the Immigration Judge did not engage in fact-finding
related to the motive behind the assault the respondent suffered in Nicaragua to determine whether
this assault may have been motivated at least in part by an actual or imputed protected ground
(IJ at 11-13; Tr. at 96-99, 143; Respondent's Br. at 2-5). See Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526,
532 (BIA 2011) (noting that a persecutor's actual motive is a matter of fact to be found by the
Immigration Judge, reviewed by the Board for clear error). Thus, as the Board cannot make
findings of fact in the first instance on appeal, we must remand the record to the Immigration Judge
for further consideration of the respondent's applications for relief. See 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (setting forth the Board's limited fact-finding authority on appeal).
Specifically, on remand, the Immigration Judge should assess whether the individuals who
harmed the respondent imputed a political opinion to him, and if so, whether such imputed political
opinion was “at least one central reason” that the respondent was harmed in Nicaragua.?

We note that the Immigration Judge did not fully explain whether the harm the respondent
experienced in Nicaragua constituted past persecution. See Matter of D-1-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448,
451 (BIA 2008) (“Because the regulations set forth varying burdens of proof depending on whether
an applicant suffered past persecution, it is of paramount importance that Immigration Judges

Master of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 529 (explaining that an asylum applicant must demonstrate that a
protected ground was “at least one central reason” for the claimed persecution). The Immigration
Judge should also consider whether the individuals who harmed the respondent were government
actors, or, if not, whether the Nicaraguan government is unable or unwilling to control these actors.
See Marter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 343 (A.G. 2018) (emphasizing the factual nature of the
inquiry into whether a purported persecutor is a government actor); see also Khalili v. Holder,
557 F.3d 429, 436 (6th Cir. 2009) (providing that the issue of whether a government is unwilling
or unable to control actions by non-state actors is a factual determination).

If the respondent does not establish that he suffered past persecution on account of an imputed
political opinion, then the Immigration Judge should analyze whether the respondent has an
objectively reasonable well-founded fear of persecution should he retum to Nicaragua. See
8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(i) (explaining that, in the absence of past persecution, an asylum
applicant bears the burden to demonstrate “a reasonable possibility” of suffering persecution on
account of a protected ground). On the other hand, should the Immigration Judge determine that
the respondent was persecuted on account of an imputed political opinion in Nicaragua, then the
DHS bears the burden to rebut the presumption that the respondent maintains a well-founded fear
of persecution by demonstrating either (1) a fundamental change in circumstances in Nicaragua,
or (2) that there is an area within Nicaragua where the respondent could relocate to avoid future
persecution and that, under the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the respondent to
do so. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(i)-(ii).

Given the foregoing, we decline to address the respondent's remaining appellate arguments.
See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 170 (BIA 2013) (reiterating the general rule that courts and
agencies are not required to make findings on issues which are not dispositive to the outcome of
cases) (citing INS v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976)). On remand, both parties should be
provided the opportunity to update the record with relevant evidence, including evidence of current
country conditions in Nicaragua. The Immigration Judge should also reassess the respondent's
claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture based on any additional fact finding or
as he otherwise deems appropriate. In remanding, we express no opinion as to the ultimate
outcome of these proceedings.
