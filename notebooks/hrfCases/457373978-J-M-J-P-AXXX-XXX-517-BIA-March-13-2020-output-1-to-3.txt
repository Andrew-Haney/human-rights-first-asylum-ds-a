IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
Rachel A. Naggar, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Jessica C. Wallace
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent has appealed from the Immigration Judge's decision dated September 25, 2019.
The Immigration Judge found the respondent had failed, within the time prescribed, to submit his
completed application for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158 and 1231(b)(3), and protection under
the Convention Against Torture, under 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16 through 1208.18. Consequently, the
Immigration Judge found the application abandoned. The appeal will be sustained and the record
remanded.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
Upon review, it appears the Immigration Judge was under the impression that the
respondent's final hearing was the third master calendar reset hearing, whereas it was the second
(Tr. at 58). Further, the respondent had not abandoned his application, but had taken the necessary
steps to have his application translated more than a week before the final hearing (Br. at 4;
Tr. at 62). In addition, the respondent asked for a one-week continuance, whereas the Immigration
Judge, in denying the request, stated the request was for two weeks (Tr. at 62). Finally, the record
reflects that the respondent has submitted a completed asylum application in English.
In view of all of the foregoing, the record will be remanded to provide the respondent an
opportunity to file his asylum application and for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
