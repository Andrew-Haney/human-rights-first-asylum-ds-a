In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Ondine G. Sniffin, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening; reconsideration
The respondent, a native and citizen of Guatemala, was ordered removed from the United
States in absentia on August 1, 2018. He has filed an appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision
dated November 2, 2018, denying the respondent's motion to reconsider the October 3, 2018,
decision denying his motion to reopen the August 1, 2018, removal order. The Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) has not filed a brief in response to the appeal. The appeal will be
sustained.

Upon de novo review, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii), we conclude that reopening is warranted in
light of the totality of the circumstances presented in this case. In particular, the Immigration
Judge found that the respondent had met his burden to show that he did not receive notice of his
hearing and it was through no fault of the respondent (IJ Dec, October 2, 2018). The respondent
had a pending asylum application, alleging a fear of harm on account of his race and membership
in a particular social group (Exh. 2). The respondent showed due diligence in promptly seeking
to redress the situation by filing his motion less than two months after the issuance of the in
absentia order, and DHS did not file an opposition to either the motion or the appeal. The
respondent has also submitted an application for cancellation of removal (Form 42-B) and
evidence of U.S. citizen children, who are qualifying relatives.
In Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec. 349,353 (BIA 1998), we held that “[o]nce an in absentia order
is rescinded, the alien is then given a new opportunity to litigate the issues previously resolved
against the alien) at the in absentia hearing. In other words, the deportation proceedings go back
to the start, the Service must proceed to prove deportability under the allegations in the original
Order to Show Cause, and the alien must establish any eligibility for relief. ... The alien is returned
to the same status (he or] she had prior to the in absentia hearing, namely, an alien charged with
deportability and subject to the already-initiated deportation proceedings.”
The Immigration Judge here improperly denied the motion to reopen for failure to establish
prima facie eligibility for relief. Instead, because the respondent established that he never received
notice of his hearing, the proceedings should be rescinded. Matter of M-S-, 22 I&N Dec.at 353.
Thus, we will sustain the appeal and reopen the proceedings to allow the respondent another
opportunity to appear for a hearing before an Immigration Judge. Accordingly, the following
orders shall be entered.

ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The Immigration Judge's August 1, 2018, order of removal is vacated,
proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
pr ings consistent with the foregoing.
