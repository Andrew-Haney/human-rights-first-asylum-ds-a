IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Ramiro J. Lluis, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal
The respondents,' natives and citizens of El Salvador, appeal from the Immigration Judge's
decision dated June 21, 2018, denying their applications for asylum pursuant to section
208(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A), withholding of
removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), and protection
under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18.2 The
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The record will be
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of Immigration Judges
de novo. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The respondents in this case are the lead respondent, who is the mother (A206-720-299), her
minor son (A206-720-300), and her adult daughter (A206-720-301). All three respondents
subinitted individual applications for asylum, and the applications filed by the lead respondent
includes the other two respondents as derivative beneficiaries. See section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act;
8 C.F.R. § 1208.3(a); see also Matter of A-K-, 24 I&N Dec. 275, 279 (BIA 2007) (stating that
although section 208(b)(3)(A) of the Act provides for derivative asylum, it does not provide for
derivative withholding of removal). At the final hearing and with the assistance of counsel, only
the lead respondent chose to testify, and the other respondents did not set forth any separate basis
for their claims. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “respondent” shall refer to the lead
respondent, the term “male respondent” shall refer to her minor son, and the term “female
respondent” shall refer to her adult daughter.

Because the respondents do not meaningfully challenge the Immigration Judge's denial of their
applications for protection under the Convention Against Torture, we deem these applications
waived on appeal. See, e.g., Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012).

-299 et al.
The respondent seeks relief and protection from removal based on a fear of gang members in
El Salvador (IJ at 7; Tr. at 25). The Immigration Judge found the respondent to be a credible
witness but concluded that she did not meet her burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum
or withholding of removal (IJ at 7-9). Specifically, the Immigration Judge determined that she did
not demonstrate a nexus exists between her past or future harm and a statutorily protected ground
(IJ at 7-8). The Immigration Judge also concluded that she did not establish the Salvadoran
government is unable or unwilling to protect her from the private actors she fears (IJ at 9). The
respondents challenge these determinations on appeal (Respondents’ Br. at 9-13).
We conclude that a remand of the record is appropriate because the Immigration Judge's
decision does not contain sufficient factual findings or conclusions of law to allow for meaningful
appellate review. See Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 2002) (holding that the Board has
limited fact-finding ability on appeal, which heightens the need for Immigration Judges to include
in their decisions clear and complete findings of fact that are supported by the record and are in
compliance with controlling law); Matter of A-P-, 22 I&N Dec. 468, 477 (BIA 1999) (stating that
an Immigration Judge's decision should accurately summarize relevant facts, reflect analysis of
applicable legal precedents, and clearly set forth legal conclusions); see also 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (stating that the Board may not engage in fact-finding in the course of deciding
appeals except for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts).
In this case, the Immigration Judge did not make clear factual findings regarding the gang
members' motivations for targeting the respondent. See Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526, 532
(BIA 2011) (stating that motive is a finding of fact). The Immigration Judge concluded that the
gang members harmed the respondent neither on account of her religion nor her membership in a
particular social group, but he did not identify their actual motivations (IJ at 8). In determining
whether a respondent has established a nexus to a protected characteristic, an adjudicator must
consider “direct or circumstantial” evidence of a persecutor's motive. See INS v. Elias-Zacarias,
502 U.S. 478, 483 (1992); see also Madrigal v. Holder, 716 F.3d 499, 504-05 (9th Cir. 2013).
Moreover, although eligibility for asylum requires that a protected ground serve at least “one
central reason” for the persecution, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the
jurisdiction in which this case arises, has held that the less demanding “a reason” standard applies
for withholding of removal. See Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 359-60 (9th Cir. 2017).

In addition, the Immigration Judge should further fact-find and re-examine his analysis
regarding whether the respondent has established that the Salvadoran government is unable or
unwilling to protect her from the gang members (IJ at 9). Although the respondent never reported
the harm she witnessed or experienced to the police, a failure to report alone is not dispositive of
the issue (IJ at 9). See Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051, 1069-70 (9th Cir. 2017);
see also Ornelas-Chavez v. Gonzales, 458 F.3d 1052, 1058 (9th Cir. 2006) (stating that a
respondent need not have reported past persecution to the authorities “if he can convincingly
establish that doing so would have been futile or have subjected him to further abuse”).
Therefore, we will remand the record for additional factual findings and analysis regarding
whether the respondent has established a nexus to a protected ground and if the Salvadoran
government is unable or unwilling to protect her from her feared persecutors. The
Immigration Judge should specifically identify any evidence he relies on and explain the reasons

for his conclusions to permit meaningful appellate review. Because we are remanding the record,
we decline to address the respondent's remaining arguments on appeal. The Immigration Judge
may take any other action he deems necessary and appropriate for resolution of the respondent's
case. In remanding, we express no opinion regarding the ultimate outcome of these proceedings.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.

Appellate Immigration Judge Keith E. Hunsucker respectfully dissents without opinion.
