IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Maite C. Garcia, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Amold Eslava-Grunwaldt
Deputy Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico and a lawful permanent resident of the United
States, appeals from the Immigration Judge's April 8, 2019, decision finding him removable as
charged and denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under
the Convention Against Torture. See sections 208, 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). The Department of Homeland Security
(“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The record will be remanded.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge for clear error. 8 C.F.R. ſ 1003.1(2)(3)(i). We review all other issues,
including questions of law and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1()(3)(ii).
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding that his 2006
conviction for shoplifting in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes § 13-1805(A)(1) is a crime
involving moral turpitude and in sustaining the charge of removability (Respondent's Br. at 5,
8-19; Exh. 3). He also argues that the Immigration Judge did not act as a neutral fact-finder and
that his mental competency should have been assessed (Respondent's Br. at 5, 19-24).
As competency is a threshold issue, we turn to that first. Given the particular circumstances
present in this matter, we conclude that a remand is warranted for the Immigration Judge to
evaluate the respondent's mental competency. While an Immigration Judge is under no obligation
to analyze an alien's competency absent indicia of incompetency, there were indicia of
incompetency before the Immigration Judge. See Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474,477, 479
(BIA 2011) (explaining that indicia of incompetency can include "certain behaviors by the
respondent, such as the inability to understand and respond to questions, the inability to stay on
topic, or a high level of distraction,” as well as "evidence of mental illness," including "direct
assessments of the respondent's mental health”).

The respondent submitted medical records indicating that he was diagnosed with anxiety
and prescribed various medications, including the antipsychotic risperidone, while in detention
(Exh. 19). These records also indicate that he reported experiencing auditory hallucinations (id.).
Although a provider indicated in a progress note that the respondent appeared to be "embellishing"
his symptoms in order to obtain medication, she referred him to a psychiatrist for further
assessment and he was subsequently prescribed risperidone, buspirone, and trazodone (id.).
In addition, the conviction documents in the record contain indicia of incompetency.
According to the presentence investigation relating to the respondent's conviction for aggravated
assault, “[o]fficers who worked the area and knew the defendant ... expressed concem over his
mental stability” (Exh. 5 at 1). A release questionnaire pertaining to the same conviction contains
similar concems (Exh. 4 at 13, 15).
On appeal, the respondent, who was pro se before the Immigration Judge but is now
represented by counsel, submitted a letter from a Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project
social worker describing the interactions staff has had with the respondent that describe mental
health issues (Respondent's Br., Tab A). The respondent also submitted additional medical
records from detention, some of which are duplicative of Exhibit 19, and an officer report from
the aggravated assault arrest describing the respondent as “mentally unstable” (Respondent's Br.,
Tabs A-B). The transcript does not reflect that competency issues were discussed during any of
the respondent's hearings.
Based on the above indicia of incompetency, the Immigration Judge will need to take measures
to determine whether the respondent is competent to participate in these proceedings under the
guidelines outlined in Matter of M-A-M-. See also Mejia v. Sessions, 868 F.3d 1118, 1121-22 (9th
Cir. 2017) (holding that “clear indicia” of incompetency, which included a history of serious
mental illness, testimony by the alien that he was not taking his medication and was experiencing
symptoms of mental illness, and “confused and disjointed” testimony, "triggered an (Immigration
Judge's) duty to explain whether (an alien) was competent and whether procedural safeguards
were needed."). If, on remand, the respondent is pro se, the Immigration Judge should also follow
the guidelines outlined in Franco-Gonzalez v. Holder, No. CV 10-02211, 2013 WL 3674492 (C.D.
Cal. Apr. 23, 2013) (partial judgment and permanent injunction order), as amended by Franco-
Gonzalez v. Holder, No. CV 2:10-02211, 2014 WL 5475097 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2014) (order
further implementing permanent injunction). On remand, the DHS has an obligation to provide
the court with relevant materials in its possession that would inform the court about the
respondent's mental competency. Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 480 (noting that the DHS
"will often be in possession of relevant evidence, particularly where the alien is detained").

If, after considering all appropriate evidence, the Immigration Judge determines that the
respondent lacks sufficient competency to proceed with the hearing, the Immigration Judge should
identify and apply appropriate safeguards, conduct a new hearing, and articulate his or her
reasoning in the decision. Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. at 483-84; see generally Matter of
M-J-K-, 26 I&N Dec. 773 (BIA 2016).
In addition, if the Immigration Judge finds evidence of mental health concems, he or she should
consider that evidence in reevaluating whether the respondent was convicted of a particularly

serious crime (IJ at 8-9). See Gomez-Sanchez v. Sessions, 892 F.3d 985 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding
that an alien's mental health can be considered as a factor in the particularly serious crime
determination). On remand, both parties should be given the opportunity to submit additional
evidence regarding the respondent's competency. In light of our disposition of this matter, we
decline to address the remaining appellate arguments at this time.
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion
and for the entry of a new decision.
