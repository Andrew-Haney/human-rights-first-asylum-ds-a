IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Jessica L. Perez-Salazar, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Susan Onyewuchi
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Cuba, appeals the Immigration Judge's February 19,
2020, decision denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant to
sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
$$ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A), as well as his request for protection under the Convention
Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16-1208.18. The record will be remanded.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent sought relief claiming that he has been and will be persecuted by Cuban
authorities on account of his anti-government political opinion (IJ at 2; Exh. 2). In support of his
claim, the respondent testified that he was repeatedly detained and beaten by authorities between
2015 and 2019 (IJ at 2; Tr. at 60-62, 66-68). He specifically recalled that he was first arrested and
beaten with a baton in 2015; he suffered a broken rib as a result of this beating, and was treated in
a hospital for 20 days (IJ at 2-3; Tr. at 60-61, 63). He also noted that, in 2018, an officer pushed
him to the ground causing him to break his tooth (IJ at 3; Tr. at 67). He lastly noted that he was
slapped by authorities in 2019 after refusing to participate in an election (IJ at 3; Tr. at 62, 64-65).
The Immigration Judge deemed the respondent credible, but denied his application for asylum
concluding that he did not demonstrate that his past harm constituted persecution, or that he had
an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of future persecution (IJ at 3-5). On appeal, the
respondent maintains that he established that he suffered past persecution and that he has a well-
founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion (Respondent's Br. at 10-18).
We agree with the respondent's appellate contention that the Immigration Judge erred in
finding that his past harm did not amount to persecution (Respondent's Br. at 10-12). The
respondent credibly testified that he was repeatedly threaten and beaten over a four year period (IJ
at 2; Tr. at 60-62, 66-68). During the first of these beatings, authorities used a baton to break the
respondent's rib, and he subsequently spent 20 days being treated in a hospital (IJ at 2-3; Tr. at 60-
61, 63). Later, in 2018, authorities pushed the respondent to the ground, causing him to break his

tooth (IJ at 3; Tr. at 67). Additionally, although not considered by the Immigration Judge, the
record reflects that the respondent also indicated that, while working at shop that belonged to the
Department of Agriculture in 2019, he was summoned to a director's office after failing to
participate in a political event and admonished; he was subsequently let go from his position (Tr.
at 62, 71-72; Respondent's Br. at 7). Therefore, considering the cumulative harm to the respondent
upon our de novo review, we conclude this harm amounted to past persecution. See Niftaliev v.
U.S. Att'y Gen., 504 F.3d 1211, 1217 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding past persecution based on the
cumulative effect of discrimination, numerous beatings and threats, and a fifteen-day detention);
see also Matter of T-Z-, 24 I&N Dec. 163, 171 (BIA 2007) (noting that nonphysical forms of harm,
such as the deliberate imposition of severe economic disadvantage or deprivation of employment,
or other essentials of life, may amount to persecution).
Therefore, we will remand proceedings for the Immigration Judge to determine in the first
instance whether this past persecution was inflicted on account of the respondent's political
opinion. Should the Immigration Judge determine that the past persecution was inflicted on
account of a protected ground, he should further consider whether the DHS has met its burden to
rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). The
respondent does not challenge the Immigration Judge's denial of his request for protection under
the Convention Against Torture, and we therefore deem any such argument to be waived (IJ at 5-
6). See Matter of M-D-C-V-, 28 I&N Dec. 18, 18 n.1 (BIA 2020) (collecting cases and explaining
that absent a meaningful challenge to the Immigration Judge's denial of relief or protection, the
issue is not properly before the Board). Consequently, on remand, the Immigration Judge need
only reassess the respondent's eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. The parties may
supplement the record on remand.

Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for the Immigration Judge to conduct further proceedings
and for the entry of a new decision consistent with this order.

FOR THE BOARD
1
We note that the Immigration Judge assumed without deciding that the respondent was harmed
on account of his political opinion for the purposes of his past persecution analysis (IJ at 3).
2
Although the Immigration Judge also found that the respondent did not establish a well-founded
fear of persecution, he did not shift the burden of proof to the DHS as to that issue (IJ at 3-5).
