IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Khagendra G. Chhetry, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Michael J. Smith
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, has appealed from the Immigration Judge's
April 3, 2019, written decision denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal
under sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
$$ 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3); and protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.16-18. The Department of Homeland Security opposes the appeal. For the reasons set
out below, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for the issuance of a new
decision.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including credibility determinations, under
the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including
issues of law, discretion, and judgment, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
In the proceedings below, the respondent pursued applications for relief based on his claim
that members of the Awami League Party (ALP) attacked him on October 26, 2017, and March 30,
2018 (IJ at 6-7; Tr. at 41-51). The respondent believed that he was attacked because he refused to
quit his own party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and join the ALP (IJ at 6-7; Tr. at 41, 46).
However, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent's applications for relief based, in
significant part, on an adverse credibility determination (see IJ at 5-7,9).
An adverse credibility determination is based on a “totality of the circumstances” and an
Immigration Judge must provide “specific and cogent reasons” for a determination. Singh v,
Sessions, 880 F.3d 220, 225 (5th Cir. 2018) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). An
Immigration Judge may base an adverse credibility determination on relevant factors, including
demeanor, responsiveness, inherent plausibility, consistency between statements, consistency
between statements and other evidence, and inaccuracies, “without regard to whether an
inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant's claim, or any other
relevant factor.” Section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act. In addition, an adverse credibility
determination may rely on an omission. See Ghotra v. Whitaker, 912 F.3d 284, 289
(5th Cir. 2019).

We conclude that a remand is warranted in this case because the Immigration Judge's adverse
credibility determination is clearly erroneous. First, the Immigration Judge found that the
respondent's testimony that he was alone during the October 2017 attack was inconsistent with his
statement during the credible fear interview' that five people attacked “us.” (IJ at 6; compare Tr.
at 54-55 with Exh. 4A at 8). However, during his credible fear interview, the respondent also
indicated that he was traveling “by [him)self in a rickshaw with a puller (Exh. 4A at 8).
Consequently, there is not an inconsistency because the “us” apparently references the respondent
(who was traveling alone) and the rickshaw puller. Second, although the respondent did not
mention in his credible fear interview that he was attacked with a butcher knife in October 2017
or hockey sticks in March 2018 (see IJ at 6; Tr. at 55-56, 68-69; Exh. 4A), he did reference these
specific means of attack in the statement accompanying his asylum application (Form I-589) (Exh.
3B).
Third, in assessing these omissions, and the respondent's overall credibility, the Immigration
Judge was required to consider the “totality of the circumstances.” However, the Immigration
Judge did not address much of the respondent's corroborative evidence in conjunction with his
adverse credibility determination (see IJ at 5-7 and Group Exh. 3). Fourth, regarding the
respondent's medical treatment and injuries, we conclude that (a) the respondent's testimony that
he suffered severe injuries, including to his hand/wrist, is not necessarily inconsistent with the
more specific diagnosis in a doctor's note of a fractured hand/wrist (compare Tr. at 56-58 with
Exh. 3T at 75); and (b) the Immigration Judge's finding that a prescription would not be written
in English in the country of Bangladesh is based on conjecture (see IJ at 6; Tr. at 60-65). See
Wang v. Holder, 569 F.3d 531,537 (5th Cir. 2009) (stating that credibility determinations may not
be based on pure speculation).

Finally, we conclude that the remaining reasons cited by the Immigration Judge, including
immaterial inconsistencies regarding the issuance or use of a passport, are insufficient to support
an adverse credibility determination. Consequently, we find it appropriate to remand the record
to the Immigration Judge to reassess the respondent's credibility, particularly in light of the
extensive evidence submitted to corroborate his claims of past harm. On remand, the Immigration
Judge should also consider whether the respondent has met his burden of proof for relief based on
the merits (irrespective of the adverse credibility determination). Accordingly, the following
order is entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for the issuance of a new decision
consistent with the foregoing decision.
FØR THE BOARD
| The credible fear interview notes state that they are not a verbatim transcript of the credible fear
interview (Exh. 4A at 3).

Although the Immigration Judge's decision appears to have an alternative finding on the merits,
it still relies, in part, on the adverse credibility determination, particularly when analyzing the
respondent's application for protection under the Convention Against Torture.
