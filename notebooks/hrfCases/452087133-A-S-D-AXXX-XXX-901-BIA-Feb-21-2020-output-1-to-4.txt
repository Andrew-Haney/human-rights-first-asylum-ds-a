IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Hassan M. Ahmad, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Anne Gannon
Senior Attorney
APPLICATION: Deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture
The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) appeals from the Immigration Judge's
August 30, 2019, decision granting the respondent's application for deferral of removal to Russia
under the Convention Against Torture.' See 8 C.F.R. 88 1208.16(c)-1208.18. The respondent, a
native of the Soviet Union and citizen of Russia, opposes the appeal.2 The appeal will be
dismissed, and the record will be remanded for updated background checks.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. G 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent requested protection from removal based on his fear that he will be tortured by
Russian authorities for suspected terrorist activities in Russia. The respondent is the subject of an
Interpol Red Notice from Russia implicating that the respondent is wanted for the participation of
terrorist-related activities and for being in an “organized criminal group” (IJ at 10; Exh. 5). The
Immigration Judge expressed concern over the respondent's lack of forthrightness in his initial
2010 asylum application (“Form 1-589") filed with the United States Citizenship and Immigration
Services and in his application to register permanent residence or adjust status (“Form 1-485") (IJ
at 9). The Immigration Judge did not find the omissions significant enough to warrant an adverse
credibility finding, but did not make an explicit credibility finding (IJ at 10). The Immigration
Judge also concluded that the respondent met his burden to demonstrate his eligibility for deferral
of removal under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 10-13).

On appeal, the DHS challenges the Immigration Judge's findings in this case. Specifically,
the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding the respondent credible based on the
totality of circumstances (DHS’s Br. at 19). The DHS also argues that the Immigration Judge
erred in finding that the respondent met his burden to establish his eligibility for deferral of removal
under the Convention Against Torture (DHS’s Br. at 26). The DHS further contends that the
Immigration Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the respondent to the DHS and
set forth standards of proof not supported by the law (DHS’s Br. at 34).
We must affirm the Immigration Judge's findings if they are based on a permissible view of
the evidence, even if we would have made different findings had we been the Immigration Judge.
See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985) (“Where there are two
permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly
erroneous.”). As the Immigration Judge did not make an explicit credibility determination, the
respondent has a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal (IJ at 9-10). See generally section
240(c)(4)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(C) (stating in the
relief context that if no adverse credibility finding is explicitly made, there shall be a rebuttable
presumption of credibility on appeal). The DHS has attempted to rebut the presumption of
credibility on appeal.
Despite the DHS's appellate arguments, and given the totality of the circumstances presented,
we discern no clear error in the Immigration Judge's factual findings (DHS's Br. at 19-26). See
section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). While the Immigration Judge was
concerned about the respondent's lack of forthrightness about his prior activities in Russia in his
initial asylum application and Form 1-485, the Immigration Judge found that the respondent's
testimony regarding his fear of return to Russia and torture was largely consistent (IJ at 9; Exhs.
5, 19). In addition, the Immigration Judge noted the respondent's explanation that he disclosed all
of the information regarding his activities to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during his
interviews, the statements of which have been incorporated by reference into the record (IJ at 10;
Tr. at 191-92; Exhs. 5, 19). Further, while the Immigration Judge found that the respondent has
not sufficiently corroborated his claim that the twenty-nine individuals who were arrested by the
Russian Federal Security Service were, in fact, tortured during their detention, the Immigration
Judge found that independent evidence in the record establishes that the respondent is more likely
than not to be tortured in Russia upon his return (IJ at 10; Tr. at 157-58, 205-06). See
Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 184-85 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that an alien's claim for
protection under the Convention Against Torture may not be denied solely on the basis of a
determination that the alien's testimony is not credible and that an alien need only proffer objective
evidence that he or she is likely to be tortured in the future to prevail on such a claim).

Upon review of the record and the parties' appellate arguments, we conclude there is not a
sufficient basis to disturb the Immigration Judge's ultimate determination that the respondent has
met his burden to demonstrate his eligibility for deferral of removal under the Convention Against
Torture. We cannot conclude that the Immigration Judge clearly erred when she found it is more
likely than not that the respondent will be tortured in Russia in connection with the Russian
authorities' investigation of his suspected activities. See Maller of Z-2-0-, 261&N Dec. 586,590
(BIA 2015) (reviewing an Immigration Judge's predictive findings for clear error). The Russian
government has issued an Interpol Red Notice requesting the respondent’s arrest and extradition,

and the country conditions reports reflect that the authorities' use of torture is widespread and
systemic throughout the Russian criminal justice system (IJ at 10-13; Exhs. 19, 29, 32). See
8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(3)(iii)-(iv). Given the Immigration Judge's factual findings in this case, we
do not disturb the Immigration Judge's determination that the respondent has met his burden to
establish that it is more likely than not he will be tortured by or at the instigation of or with the
consent or acquiescence (to include the concept of willful blindness) of a public official or other
person acting in an official capacity upon removal to Russia, and that he could not relocate to a
part of Russia where he is not likely to be tortured (IJ at 13). 8 C.F.R. $81208.16(c)(2);
1208.18(a)(1); Khouzam v. Ashcroft, 361 F.3d 161, 170 (2d Cir. 2004). Consequently, we will
remand the record solely to complete or update necessary security or background checks.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The Department of Homeland Security's appeal is dismissed.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
opportunity to complete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or
examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by
8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(h).
