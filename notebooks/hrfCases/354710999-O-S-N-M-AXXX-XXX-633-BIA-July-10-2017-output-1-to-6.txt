IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Thomas P. Clancy, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Nicholle Hempel
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Termination
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has appealed the Immigration Judge's
January 19, 2017, decision granting the respondent’s motion to terminate proceedings. The DHS's
appeal will be sustained, the proceedings will be reinstated, and the matter will be administratively
closed.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including whether the parties have met their relevant burden of proof, and issues
of discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent is a native and citizen of Guatemala who entered the United States without
authorization on or about August 15, 2015, when he was 16 years old. The respondent was
designated as an Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC). The Immigration Judge terminated the
respondent's removal proceedings because he is the beneficiary of an approved petition for Special
Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status (Form I-360) (IJ at 2-3; Respondent's Motion to Terminate, Tab
A). The Immigration Judge reasoned that it was in the interest of justice and judicial economy to
terminate proceedings to allow the respondent to file his application for adjustment of status (Form
1-485) with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (IJ at 2-3).
However, the Immigration Judge erred in terminating proceedings because the priority date for
the respondent's petition is not yet current, and thus, the respondent cannot adjust his status at this
time. Thus, the respondent remains removable from the United States as alleged in the Notice to
Appear and is not currently eligible for relief from removal. Accordingly, we will sustain the
DHS's appeal and reinstate the respondent's removal proceedings.
While we conclude that termination in this case is inappropriate, administrative closure is
warranted. According to the guidance provided to Immigration Judges by the Chief Immigration
Judge, “administrative closure might be warranted” in cases where an unaccompanied child is
seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile status, as the process can be lengthy. See Memorandum from
Brian M. O'Leary, Chief Immigration Judge, to Immigration Judges (March 24, 2015)

(“Docketing Practices Relating to Unaccompanied Children Cases and Adults with Children
Released on Alternatives to Detention Cases in Light of New Priorities”). In view of the
respondent's approved SIJ petition, and the totality of the circumstances presented, the
respondent's removal proceedings will be administratively closed. See Matter of Avetisyan,
25 I&N Dec. 688, 696 (BIA 2012).
If either party to this case wishes to reinstate the proceedings, a written request to reinstate the
proceedings may be made to the Board. The Board will take no further action in the case unless a
request is received from one of the parties. The request must be submitted directly to the Clerk's
Office, without fee, but with certification of service on the opposing party. Accordingly, the
following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The DHS's appeal is sustained and the removal proceedings against the respondent
are reinstated.
FURTHER ORDER: The proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals in this case
is administratively closed.

IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
RESPONDENTS
APPLICATION:
Motion to Terminate Proceedings
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT:
ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT:
Assistant Chief Counsel
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
606 South Olive Street, Eighth Floor
Los Angeles, California 90014
DECISION AND ORDERS OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Before the Court is a Motion to Terminate Proceedings (Motion) filed by Respondent. In
the Motion, the Respondent moves the Court to terminate these proceedings without prejudice so
that Respondent may have United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) accept
the application for adjustment of status for adjudication. The Government opposes the motion as
a matter of policy. Having considered the arguments and evidence of record, the Court finds good
cause to GRANT the Motion.
I. STATEMENT OF THE CASE
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) commenced these removal proceedings
against the Respondents pursuant to its authority under section 240 of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA).' DHS commenced these proceedings by issuing Respondent a Notice to
Appear (NTA), and filing it with the Immigration Court.
The Respondent seeks relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status under section
245(a) of the INA. The basis for the Respondents' adjustment application is special immigrant
juvenile status (SIJS) petitions (Form I-360), which has already been filed with and approved by
USCIS.
1
The Government encountered the Respondents when they arrived in the United States as Unaccompanied Alien
Children (UAC).
In the instant Motion, the Respondent moves the Court to terminate the instant proceedings
without prejudice so that the adjustment application (Form 1-485) may be filed with USCIS. DHS
opposes any motion to terminate or administratively close these proceedings as a matter of policy,
but has no objection to a continuance until the priority date for the visa is current for the motion to
terminate to be granted.
II. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS OF THE COURT
USCIS adjudicates SIJS petitions, which are filed on Form I-360. In adjudicating such
petitions, USCIS must determine whether the petitioner qualifies as a “special immigrant
juvenile,” which requires that the petitioner be: (1) present in the U.S.; (2) under 21 years of age;
(3) declared dependent upon a juvenile court in the U.S., or legally committed to or placed under
the custody of an agency or department of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State or
juvenile court; (4) the subject of a determination that reunification with one or both parents is not
viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under State law; and, (5) the subject
of a determination in administrative or judicial proceedings that returning to his or her country of
nationality or last habitual residence is not in his or her best interest. See INA § 101(a)(27)(J).
Once USCIS approves a petitioner's Form 1-360, she is eligible for an EB-4 visa, which
allows the petitioner to adjust her status to that of a lawful permanent resident. However, EB-4
visas are subject to availability. See INA § 202(a)(2). According to the most recent Department
of State visa bulletin, the priority date for EB-4 visas is not current for petitioners from El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Once the priority date is current, the respondent may file
the adjustment of status application along with the approved I-360 visa petition.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
In the instant case, the Respondent has a previously received findings from the Superior
Court of the State of California that Respondent is a dependent upon a juvenile court, agency,
department, or individual located in the United States, and that returning the Respondent to the
country of nationality is not in Respondent's best interest. See Id.. In addition, the visa petition
has been approved by USCIS. The only matter remaining is for the visa petition to become current.
DHS's has no objection to a continuance for that purpose but, as a matter of policy, opposes any
termination until the visa is current.
Upon the commencement of removal proceedings, the Court has exclusive jurisdiction to
consider applications for relief from removal, including adjustment of status. 8 C.F.R. $$
1240.11, 1245.2(a)(1). However, this Court may not accept an adjustment application (Form
1-485) from the Respondent, because the EB-4 visas are not currently available. 8 C.F.R. §
1245.1(a). Thus, until the Respondent, who has been deemed eligible for special juvenile
immigrant status, can file the adjustment application with the Court, Respondent will denied
benefits to which they are entitled, including employment authorization. See 8 C.F.R. §
274a.12(c)(9). Nor may USCIS accept an adjustment application from the Respondent while
these removal proceedings are pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1245.2(a)(1).
The Court has carefully considered the record as a whole. The Respondent arrived in the
2
United States as unaccompanied child and has been deemed to qualify for special immigrant
juvenile status by the State court. The Court finds it in the Respondent’s best interest to permit
Respondent to pursue the adjustment application with USCIS, which the agency is willing to
accept at this point in time.
Further, it is uncertain when the Respondent's visa may become available. Therefore,
keeping the Respondent's cases on the calendar will more likely than not result in continuances
and/or motions to advance further exacerbating the Court's already crowded docket. Such
circumstances impede the Court's ability to achieve the efficient administration of justice while
maintaining fairness in the course of resolving disputes. The Court must focus resources on
matters ripe for resolution. Thus, the Court finds good cause to grant the Respondent's requests
to terminate these proceedings.
Finally, the Government is not prejudiced by the termination of these proceedings, as the
Court will enter the order of termination without prejudice. Therefore, the Government is free to
institute removal proceedings against the Respondent in the future if Respondent is not successful
with the adjudication of the adjustment applications.
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the Respondent has established good cause to
teminate the instant proceedings. Thus, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court will GRANT
the Respondent's Motion, and enter the following Orders:
ORDERS
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Terminate Proceedings filed by the
Respondent be GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that these proceedings are hereby TERMINATED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
