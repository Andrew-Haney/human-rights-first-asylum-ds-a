IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Nene T. Samb, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Meida S. Powery
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Reopening
On May 22, 2017, the Immigration Judge granted the respondent preconclusion voluntary
departure and deemed all applications for relief waived. The respondent, a native and citizen of
Cote D'Ivoire, argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his prior
proceedings, did not knowingly waive his right to appeal, and was unaware that his prior attomey
was going to withdraw all applications for relief. On December 27, 2017, this Board set a briefing
schedule to allow the respondent the opportunity to elaborate on his claim. The Department of
Homeland Security (“DHS”) argues that the Immigration Judge's decision is correct and should
be affirmed. The appeal will be sustained and the record remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this decision.

Initially, the DHS argues that this Board lacks jurisdiction. We disagree. This case is properly
before us as the respondent has persuasively demonstrated that his decision to waive appeal was
not a knowing and voluntary one. See 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.3(a)(1) (“A Notice of Appeal may not be
filed by any party who has waived appeal ..."); Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec. 697 (BIA 1993); see
also Matter of Patino, 23 I&N Dec. 74 (BIA 2001) (stating that a party wishing to challenge the
validity of an appeal waiver may file either a motion to reconsider with the Immigration Judge or
an appeal directly with the Board); Matter of Rodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000)
(explaining that a waiver of the right to appeal must be knowing and voluntary to be effective).
Though the Immigration Judge's form decision indicates that the respondent's right to appeal was
waived, the transcript does not contain an explanation that accepting preconclusion voluntary
departure requires a waiver of his right to appeal (Tr. at 50-54, 57, 59). At no time did the
Immigration Judge or either party raise the issue of appeal or discuss the right to appeal. We do
not observe either an oral notification or a written stipulation reflecting the respondent's awareness
of the requirement to waive his right to appeal. Thus, the Immigration Judge lacked the authority
to grant voluntary departure prior to the completion of proceedings. Matter of Ocampo-Ugalde,
22 I&N Dec. 1301, 1303-04 (BIA 2000). Because the record does not establish that the respondent
knowingly and voluntarily waived appeal, the respondent's appeal is properly before us.
Additionally, we are persuaded by the respondent's argument that he was prejudiced by
ineffective assistance of counsel who withdrew his applications for relief without trying to
establish eligibility and failed to inform the respondent about the repercussions of accepting

A077-943-726
preconclusion voluntary departure. The respondent complied with the procedural requirements
for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as outlined in Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637,
639 (BIA 1988), and established that his former attomey's actions were prejudicial to his case. See
Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. at 640. Concerning prejudice, the respondent's counsel, among
other things, withdrew the respondent’s withholding of removal application without explanation
(Tr. at 50). The respondent argues on appeal that had a claim based upon both his political
opinion and membership in a particular social group, but that his attorney failed to advance that
claim.
Additionally, the respondent's former counsel conceded pretermission of his application for
cancellation of removal (Tr. at 40-42, 50). The DHS and Immigration Judge concluded that
because the respondent married a woman after his first marriage dissolved, but prior to their
divorce, he engaged in polygamy and cannot establish good moral character (IJ at 40-42). See
section 101(1)(3) of the Act (good moral character); section 212(a)(10)(A) (practicing
polygamists). While we agree that the respondent wrongfully married his second wife prior to a
legal divorce from his first wife, either knowingly or unknowingly, it is unclear that his actions
fall within section 212(a)(10)(A) of the Act. See generally USCIS Policy Manual, Vol. 12,
Part F, Ch. 5(H) (Oct. 2014) (“An applicant who has practiced or is practicing polygamy during
the statutory period is precluded from establishing GMC (good moral character]. Polygamy is the
custom of having more than one spouse at the same time. ... Polygamy is not the same as bigamy.
Bigamy is the crime of marrying a person while being legally married to someone else. An
applicant who has committed bigamy may be susceptible to a denial under the ‘unlawful acts'
provision.”). Without further evidence, testimony, and findings from the Immigration Judge, we
conclude that there are insufficient facts before us to determine if the respondent's cancellation of
removal claim was appropriately pretermitted.

Based on the foregoing, the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
findings consistent with this decision. The respondent should be provided the opportunity to
reapply for any available relief. Both parties should be allowed to present additional evidence on
remand.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
findings consistent with this decision.
