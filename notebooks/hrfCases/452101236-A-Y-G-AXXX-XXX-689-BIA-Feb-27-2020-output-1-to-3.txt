IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Jason A. Dzubow, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Amy Donze Sanchez
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, appeals the Immigration Judge's May 10,
2018, decision denying his application for asylum. See section 208(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $ 1158(b)(1)(A); 8 C.F.R. ſ 1208.13. The Immigration Judge
granted the respondent's application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(A) of the
Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).' The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) filed a Motion
for Summary Affirmance on appeal. The record will be remanded as set forth below.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made
by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues,
including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of discretion.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge granted the respondent withholding of removal under section
241(b)(3)(A) of the Act (IJ at 11-12). The DHS has not challenged this determination on appeal.
The sole issue on appeal is whether the Immigration Judge correctly determined that the
respondent was barred from pursuing his application for asylum from Ethiopia because he firmly
resettled in South Africa (IJ at 10-11). See section 208(b)(2)(A)(vi) of the Act. An alien “is
considered to be firmly resettled if, prior to arrival in the United States, he or she entered into
another country with, or while in that country received, an offer of permanent resident status,
citizenship, or some other type of permanent resettlement.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.15.
The DHS has the initial burden to provide prima facie evidence of an offer of fim resettlement.
Matter of A-G-G-, 25 I&N Dec. 486, 501 (BIA 2011); see also Mussie v. U.S. INS, 172 F.3d 329,
331-32 (4th Cir. 1999) (noting that once government meets initial burden of introducing some
evidence that alien has been "firmly resettled,” burden shifts to alien to demonstrate by
"As the Immigration Judge granted the respondent withholding of removal under the Act, the
Immigration Judge did not reach whether the respondent was also eligible for protection under the
Convention Against Torture.

preponderance of the evidence that alien has not been resettled). To meet this burden, the DHS
should produce “direct evidence of govermental documents indicating an alien's ability to stay
in a country indefinitely,” such as a passport or travel document. Matter of A-G-G-, 25 I&N Dec.
at 501-02. If direct evidence of an offer of fim resettlement is unavailable, “indirect evidence
may be used to show that an offer of firm resettlement has been made if it has a sufficient level of
clarity and force to establish that an alien is able to permanently reside in the country.” Id. at 502.
Second, the alien can rebut the DHS's prima facie evidence of an offer of firm resettlement by
showing by a preponderance of the evidence that such an offer has not, in fact, been made or that
he or she would not qualify for it. Matter of A-G-G-, 25 I&N Dec. at 503. Third, the Immigration
Judge should consider the totality of the evidence to determine whether an alien has rebutted the
DHS’s evidence of an offer of firm resettlement. Id. Fourth, if the Immigration Judge finds the
alien firmly resettled, the burden shifts to the alien to establish that an exception to firm
resettlement applies pursuant to 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.15(a) and (b) by a preponderance of the
evidence. Id.
We agree with the respondent's argument on appeal that while the Immigration Judge analyzed
whether the respondent had “firmly resettled” in South Africa, he did not follow the framework
and burden shifting requirements set out in Matter of A-G-G- (IJ at 10-11; Respondent’s Br. at 8).
A remand is therefore warranted to allow the Immigration Judge to apply the four-step framework
in Matter of A-G-G- in order to determine whether the respondent was “firmly resettled” in South
Africa and therefore barred from asylum.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Moreover, on appeal, the respondent has submitted new evidence that is potentially material
to the issue of whether he was firmly resettled in South Africa, namely, a letter he claims to be
from the South African government that discusses the respondent's immigration status in that
country (Respondent's Brief, Tab A). As we are remanding proceedings, the Immigration Judge
should allow the respondent an opportunity to present this new evidence and provide the DHS with
an opportunity to respond. Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.
