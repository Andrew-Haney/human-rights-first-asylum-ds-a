APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a 52-year-old native and citizen of El Salvador, appeals from the
Immigration Judge's March 3, 2015, decision denying her applications for asylum, withholding
of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture ("CAT”). The appeal will be
dismissed in part and sustained in part.
This case has a lengthy procedural history culminating in the Immigration Judge's
certification of her March 3, 2015, decision to the Board following the Board's remand directing
the Immigration Judge to apply recent jurisprudence on the evolving issue of particular social
group. See Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014), Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N
Dec. 227 (BIA 2014), and Matter of A-R-C-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014).

The factual basis of the respondent's claim was set forth in the Immigration Judge's initial
decision on September 15, 2011, and is not meaningfully disputed by the parties (9/15/11 I.J.
Dec. at 4-6). The respondent was subjected to repeated and severe abuse by the man she lived
with for more than 15 years. The couple eventually had 5 children together, who were also
abused. The respondent did not own any property or have money, and was afraid to call the
police. The respondent testified that she knew of other women who were trapped in similar
relationships.

There are three separate decisions from the Immigration Judge, which are identified by date
when cited.
Cite as: D-M-R- (BIA June 9, 2015)
In 1996, the respondent first left El Salvador for Mexico. For 3 years, she returned to
El Salvador each month because her children were still there and she was trying to bring them to
Mexico. She described recurring problems with her partner when she made her return trips. In
March 2001, the respondent first entered the United States without inspection. In 2005, she
returned to Mexico because one of her daughters was sick. Sometime later in 2005, she returned
to the United States without inspection after several unsuccessful attempts. In 2009, the
respondent was returned to Mexico by immigration officials. The respondent last entered the
United States on November 15, 2009. In May 2011, one of the respondent's sons told her that
her former partner still intends to harm her.
An asylum application must be filed within 1 year of the applicant's last arrival in the United
States. See section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. $ 1208.4(a)(2); Matter of F-P-R-,
24 I&N Dec. 681 (BIA 2008). In her September 15, 2011, decision, the Immigration Judge
found that the respondent’s May 5, 2011, asylum application was not timely filed within 1 year
of her November 15, 2009, arrival date (9/15/11 I.J. Dec. at 9). Although the respondent
concedes that the record does not currently establish that she qualifies for an exception to the
1-year filing deadline, she seeks an opportunity to further address this issue before the
Immigration Judge.
2
We conclude pursuant to our de novo review over questions of law that the respondent is
ineligible for asylum under section 208 of the Act because she did not file a timely asylum
application or establish that an exception applies. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The
respondent has been in removal proceedings since 2011. She did not challenge the 1-year bar
finding in her initial appeal in 2011, and she has not advanced any arguments in the subsequent
years that her failure to timely file was the result of changed or extraordinary circumstances.
Under these facts, we decline to remand for further consideration of the issue. We therefore
dismiss the respondent's appeal of the denial of her application for asylum.

With respect to withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, the Immigration
Judge found that the respondent met her burden of establishing that the harm she suffered rose to
the level of persecution within the meaning of the Act, and that the Salvadoran government was
unwilling or unable to control the persecutor in this case (9/15/11 I.J. Dec. at 11, 14). We agree
with the Immigration Judge's findings in these respects. The critical issue here is whether the
respondent defined a cognizable particular social group and if so, whether she was persecuted on
account of her membership in that particular social group. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1). The
respondent has advanced numerous social groups during the course of these proceedings (3/3/15
2
Because the respondent is ineligible for asylum under section 208 of the Act, she is necessarily
ineligible for humanitarian asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(iii).
3
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not been convicted of a particularly
serious crime barring her application for withholding of removal (9/15/11 I.J. Dec. at 14). The
DHS has not challenged this determination.

I.J. Dec. at 2). We will focus on the proffered social group defined as “El Salvadoran women in
domestic relationships who are unable to leave."
We recently held that depending on the facts and evidence in an individual case, victims of
domestic violence can establish membership in a cognizable particular social group that forms
the basis of a claim for asylum or withholding of removal. Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra. In that
case, we held that under the facts and evidence, “married women in Guatemala who are unable to
leave their relationship” was a cognizable particular social group. We also recently clarified our
particular social group jurisprudence. In doing so, we stated that an applicant seeking asylum or
withholding of removal based on his or her membership in a particular social group must
establish that the group is (1) composed of members who share a common immutable
characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in
question (renaming the former concept of "social visibility”). Matter of M-E-V-G-, supra;
Matter of W-G-R-, supra.
Here, the Immigration Judge found that the proposed social group “El Salvadoran women in
domestic relationships who are unable to leave” was distinguishable from “married women in
Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship” because the respondent was not married to
Jose (3/3/15 I.J. Dec. at 3). The Immigration Judge also found that the group was not defined
with particularity and did not meet the social distinction test (3/3/15 I.J. Dec. at 4).
We disagree. First, we note that our decision in Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra, does not
necessarily require that an applicant seeking asylum or withholding of removal based on
domestic violence have been married to his or her abuser. Rather, we look to the characteristics
of the relationship to determine its nature. Here, the respondent was in a lengthy relationship
with her abuser, the couple had 5 children together, and the respondent tried to leave him on
several occasions. These facts are similar to those in Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra, even though
the respondent in that case was formally married to her abuser. We are thus satisfied that the
respondent has established that members of her proffered social group share a common
immutable characteristic of being women in domestic relationships that they are unable to leave.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We also disagree with the Immigration Judge's conclusory finding that the group is not
defined with particularity (9/15/11 I.J. Dec. at 10; 3/3/15 I.J. Dec. at 3). The terms used to
describe the group – “women," "domestic relationship," and "unable to leave” can be sufficiently
particular in society, and we find them to be so here. See Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra at 393.
We also disagree that “El Salvadoran women in domestic relationships who are unable to
leave” is not socially distinct. In her September 15, 2011, decision, the Immigration Judge found
that there “is nothing from a social perspective that would distinguish the member from the rest
of the population or cause others in the proposed social group to recognize herself as a member
of the group” (9/15/11 I.J. Dec. at 10). Notably, the group analyzed in that decision was “poor
women in violent relationships in El Salvador,” not “El Salvadoran women in domestic
relationships who are unable to leave.” The Immigration Judge does not further discuss the issue
of social distinction (formally “social visibility') in her November 29, 2013, decision. In her
most recent decision, she held that “while the record suggests that victims of domestic violence
are viewed as a distinct group within society, as evidenced by laws and programs enacted for the
3
Cite as: D-M-R- (BIA June 9, 2015)
benefit of such group, the respondent's group does not appear to be as socially distinct” (3/3/15
I.J. Dec. at 4). However, in our view, these facts found by the Immigration Judge support the
proposition that the group is socially distinct. Moreover, the respondent testified that she knew
other women in similar relationships and that it was normal in Salvadoran society to be trapped
in bad relationships with no recourse from the police. Finally, the country conditions evidence
cited by the respondent on appeal supports our conclusion that the group is socially distinct
(Respondent's Br. at 20-21).
In light of the foregoing, we conclude that “El Salvadoran women in domestic relationships
who are unable to leave” is a cognizable particular social group in this case. We further find the
Immigration Judge's alternative determination that the group was not “one central reason” for
the persecution to be clearly erroneous (9/15/11 I.J. Dec. at 11, 14; 11/29/13 I.J. Dec. at 3; 3/3/15
I.J. Dec. at 4-5). See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of J-B-N- & S-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 208,
214 (BIA 2007); Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526, 532 (BIA 2011) (a persecutor's actual
motive is a matter of fact to be determined by the Immigration Judge and reviewed by this Board
for clear error). The respondent's inability to leave the relationship in the broader context of
Salvadoran society supports a nexus determination in this matter. See Matter of A-R-C-G-, supra
at 394. We therefore conclude that the respondent suffered past persecution on account of a
particular social group. Accordingly, the burden shifts to the DHS to establish that there has
been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the respondent no longer has a clear
probability of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1)(ii). Alternatively, the DHS bears the
burden of showing that internal relocation is possible and is not unreasonable (Id.).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Immigration Judge made an alternative finding that even assuming that the respondent
had established past persecution on account of a statutorily enumerated ground, the DHS met its
burden of proof on both the changed country conditions and internal relocation issues (9/15/11
I.J. Dec. at 14-15; 11/29/13 I.J. Dec. at 3; 3/3/15 I.J. Dec. at 5). The Immigration Judge reasoned
that the respondent had not been back to El Salvador for many years, and “there has been some
change in country conditions pertaining to the treatment of domestic violence matters.” (9/15/11
I.J. Dec. at 14-15) She further noted that the respondent's former domestic partner is now 59
years old, and the respondent has family members in El Salvador that could assist her.
לל
We disagree with the Immigration Judge. In our view, these limited observations by the
Immigration Judge are not sufficiently developed or linked to evidence in the record to support
the conclusions she reached. Rather, based on the record, we conclude that the DHS has not met
its burden of rebutting the presumption of future persecution or showing that internal relocation
is possible and is not unreasonable. We therefore conclude that the respondent is eligible for the
withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal of the denial of asylum under section 208 of the Act is
dismissed.
FURTHER ORDER: The respondent's appeal of the denial of withholding of removal under
section 241(b)(3) of the Act is sustained.

FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the Department of Homeland Security the
opportunity to complete or update identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or
examinations, and further proceedings, if necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.47(h).
