IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Claudia M. Garcia, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondents are an adult male and his minor daughter, both natives and citizens of El
Salvador, who were ordered removed in absentia on August 22, 2017. The respondent has filed
an appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated January 17, 2018, denying his motion to
reopen. The respondent filed a brief in support of his appeal. The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) did not file a brief in response. The appeal will be sustained.

In a statement accompanying his motion, the respondent stated, under oath, that he arrived at
the Miami, Florida, Immigration Court around 7:50 a.m. for his August 22, 2017, hearing and that
because of a delay caused by a very long line outside the courthouse, he was not able to appear
in
the Immigration Judge's courtroom until about 8:15 to 8:20 that morning. By that time, the
Immigration Judge already had ordered his removal in absentia. The respondent requested to be
given a second opportunity and stated that he never intended to abandon his case and that he wishes
to apply for political asylum because of fear to return to El Salvador.
Upon de novo review, 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii), and in light of the circumstances presented,
including the facts that the respondent exercised due diligence by filing his motion to reopen within
days after the Immigration Judge issued the in absentia order of removal and that the DHS filed
no opposition to the respondent's motion or to his appeal, we will sustain the appeal to allow the
respondent another opportunity to appear for a hearing before an Immigration Judge. See Matter
of C-R-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 677 (BIA 2008); Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008).
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
We will refer to him as the
| The male respondent is the lead respondent in this matter.
“respondent” in this order.

-347 et al.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the Immigration Judge's August 22, 2017, in absentia order
of removal is vacated, proceedings are reopened, and the record is remanded to the Immigration
Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing.
