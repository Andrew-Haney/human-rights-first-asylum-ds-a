IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL AND MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Matthew G. Holt, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals the Immigration Judge's
September 20, 2018, decision, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture. Sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158, 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). The respondent has
also filed a motion to remand. The appeal will be sustained in part, the motion to remand will be
granted, and the record of proceedings will be remanded.'

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues,
including questions of law, judgment, and issues of discretion, de novo. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent, pro se before the Immigration Judge, testified that he feared harm from
criminals that assaulted him when he refused to participate in their criminal enterprise, and on
account of his being imputed as gay or transgendered (IJ at 2-3; Tr. at 36-37, 41-46; Exhs. 1, 3).
The Immigration Judge found him credible but denied asylum and withholding of removal for lack
of nexus to a protected ground, alternatively denied asylum in the exercise of discretion, and denied
relief under the Convention Against Torture (IJ at 3-5).?
The Immigration Judge found that the respondent had not articulated a cognizable particular
social group (IJ al 3). We disagree. Matter of W-Y-C- & H-O-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 189 (BIA 2018)
(“[W]e review the ultimate determination whether a proposed group is cognizable de novo”).
The respondent testified that he feels different from other men, that others perceive him differently
and as effeminate, and he has received threats because of this; however, he does not consider
himself gay or bisexual due to his Mommon religion (Tr. at 41-45).
| The request for oral argument is denied.

The Immigration Judge found, among other things, that the respondent had not established that
the govemment would acquiesce or be willfully blind to his torture (IJ at 5). On appeal, the
respondent has not meaningfully challenged this finding, which was dispositive. Thus, we find
the argument waived. See Matter of R-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012).

The asylum officer found that the respondent’s particular social group was “sexual minorities
in Mexico” (Exh. 1). The Immigration Judge did not consider this construction, but required that
the unrepresented respondent articulate it for him. As the respondent argues in his motion to
remand, the Immigration Judge did not mention any of the threats the respondent received because
of being perceived as gay, or the fear he has of retuming to Mexico because of being perceived as
gay. Nor did the Immigration Judge consider the respondent's assertion in his Form 1-589,
Supplement B, that he was raped by his grandfather when he was a child in Mexico (Exh. 3).3
Under these circumstances, we will remand for the Immigration Judge to consider whether the
respondent has met his burden of establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of
persecution on account of his membership in the particular social group of “sexual minorities or
imputed sexual minorities in Mexico.” See Bringas-Rodriguez v. Sessions, 850 F.3d 1051, 1073
(9th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (“[S]exual orientation and sexual identity can be the basis for establishing
a particular social group").
If the respondent establishes that he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of
future persecution in Mexico because of his perceived sexual orientation, the Immigration Judge
should evaluate whether the Mexican government was or is unable or unwilling to protect him.
Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 337-38 (A.G. 2018). The Immigration Judge also may need to
reevaluate his ruling on internal relocation, because if the respondent establishes cognizable past
persecution, the burden of proof as to internal relocation will shift to the Department of Homeland
Security. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(3)(ii).

The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent's asylum application in the exercise of
discretion (IJ at 3-4). Discretionary denials of asylum are disfavored, except in the most egregious
circumstances. Matter of Pula, 19 I&N Dec. 467, 474 (BIA 1987) (“[T]he danger of persecution
should generally outweigh all but the most egregious of adverse factors."). The Immigration Judge
found that the respondent's decades in the United States, his United States citizen father, and his
eight United States citizen children were outweighed by years-old convictions for forgery for
writing a “bad check” and false statement to an officer, and for unlawfully bringing his 8-month
pregnant wife to join him in the United States (IJ at 3-4). While the respondent's criminal history
is certainly relevant, we disagree that it outweighs the positives and will reverse the determination.
See Gulla v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 911, 916 (9th Cir. 2007) (requiring Immigration Judges to balance
and weigh “all relevant favorable and adverse factors” before denying asylum in discretion, and
favorably citing Pula's standard that asylum should be discretionarily denied for only egregious
crimes).
Accordingly, we will remand for the Immigration Judge to determine in the first instance
whether the respondent has met his burden for asylum or withholding of removal.

Although the respondent further asserted in his Form 1-589, Supplement B, that he was drugged
and raped by a friend in 2014, he states in his brief on appeal that this incident occurred while he
was living in the United States (Respondent's Br. at 2). Therefore, while the incident may be
relevant to the respondent's self-identification with a particular social group, it cannot qualify as
past persecution.

See Matter of 2-2-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586, 590-91 (BIA 2015). The parties should be permitted on
remand to submit additional evidence pertinent to any outstanding issue.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained as to asylum and withholding of removal, and
his motion to remand is granted.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the
foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

FOR THE BOARD
Board Member Patricia A. Cole respectfully dissents. Even if the respondent establishes a
cognizable particular social group, the respondent has not proffered any new evidence and the
record does not support finding past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution.
Further, I would affirm the Immigration Judge's discretionary denial of asylum for reasons he
articulated.
