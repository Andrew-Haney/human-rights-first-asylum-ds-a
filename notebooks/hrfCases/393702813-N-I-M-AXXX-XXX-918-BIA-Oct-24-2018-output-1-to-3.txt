IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL AND MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Cynthia E. Everson, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Melissa Lanning
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; remand
The respondents appeal from the Immigration Judge's October 12, 2017, decision rejecting the
lead respondent's application for asylum as incomplete and abandoned, and ordering the
respondents removed to Mexico.' The Department of Homeland Security filed a brief in
opposition to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded for further
proceedings and the entry of a new decision.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On appeal, the respondent argues that the Immigration Judge abused his discretion when he
rejected the respondent's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the
Convention Against Torture (Respondent's Br. at 3-5). The respondent also argues that the
Immigration Judge erred in finding that there was no good cause to continue the proceedings
(Id. at 5-7).
At the group master calendar hearing held on July 7, 2017, the Immigration Judge provided
the respondent with a Form 1-589 application for relief, advised the respondent that her application
must be filed by the next hearing with copies for the DHS and herself, and indicated that if she did
not provide a copy to DHS, her application may be deemed abandoned (IJ at 1-2; Tr. at 17-18).

The respondents are a mother and her minor children. The mother is the lead respondent. Her
children are derivative applicants on her application for asylum. References to the singular
respondent refer to the lead respondent.

1-918 et al.
On October 12, 2017, the respondent appeared in Immigration Court with only one copy of her
asylum application. She did not have a copy of her application to provide to the DHS. When she
was asked whether she had a copy of her application for the DHS, she stated that she “forgot to
get a copy” (IJ at 2; Tr. at 24).
The Immigration Judge rejected the respondent's asylum application for failure to include a
copy for the DHS, and ordered the respondent and her accompanying children removed (IJ at 2).
See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.31(c); 1208.3(c)(2), (3). The Immigration Judge found that the “Court was
not provided with good cause to continue the proceedings” (IJ at 2). However, the Immigration
Judge did not advise the respondent that she could request a continuance for good cause shown or
consider a brief recess to enable the pro se applicant to make a copy of her asylum application
(Tr. at 25).
to
The Immigration Judge did not grant the respondent a brief recess to make a copy of the
application, and deemed the respondent's asylum application abandoned. Considering the totality
of the circumstances, including the oral instructions given at a group master calendar hearing, the
pro se respondent, and the available remedy of a brief recess to make a copy, the Immigration
Judge's decision deem the application abandoned is not appropriate. See
Matter of Interiano-Rosa, 25 I&N Dec. 264, 266 (BIA 2010) (when an application for relief is
timely filed but supporting documents are not submitted within the time established, the
Immigration Judge may deem the opportunity to file the documents to be waived but may not deem
the application itself abandoned) citing Casares-Castellon v. Holder, 603 F.3d 1111, 1113
(9th Cir. 2010) (holding that the plain language of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.31(c) does not permit deeming
a timely filed application abandoned for failure to file supplemental documents within a specified
time). We will remand record to the Immigration Judge to provide the respondents an opportunity
to resubmit the required copies of her asylum application.

Accordingly the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FUTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion and the entry of a new decision.
