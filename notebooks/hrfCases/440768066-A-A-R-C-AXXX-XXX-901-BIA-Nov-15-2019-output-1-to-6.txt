IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Faiz E. Rasul, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Laticia Bobongi
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum, withholding of removal
The respondents, a mother and son, are natives and citizens of El Salvador. They have
appealed from an Immigration Judge's November 5, 2017, decision denying their applications for
asylum and withholding of removal.' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved
for summary affirmance. The respondents' appeal will be sustained, and the record will be
remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent with this order.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the Immigration Judge's findings of fact for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i).
We review questions of law, discretion and judgment, and all other issues in appeals, de novo.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii); see also Turkson v. Holder, 667 F.3d 523, 527-28 (4th Cir. 2012).
On appeal, the respondents argue that the Immigration Judge did not consider whether the lead
respondent was persecuted or whether she had a well-founded fear of being persecuted in El
Salvador on account of membership in one of the particular social groups she identified during her
hearing. Specifically, the respondents contend that the Immigration Judge did not consider
whether the lead respondent had been persecuted on account of her membership in the group
“family members of her son.” The respondents maintain that the lead respondent received a death
threat right before she left El Salvador on account of her relationship to her son and that this threat
rises to the level of persecution. The respondents further contend that the Immigration Judge erred
when he concluded that there was insufficient evidence regarding who made the threatening phone
call.

The lead respondent has not challenged the Immigration Judge's denial of her application for
protection under the Convention Against Torture, and the minor respondent did not file an
application for this form of relief. We therefore deem any issues related to this form of relief
waived. See Matter of R-A-M, 25 I&N Dec. 657, 658 n.2 (BIA 2012).

-901 et al.
The respondents also argue that the lead respondent established that she experienced treatment
rising to the level of persecution in El Salvador on account of her membership in the particular
social group of “family members of her sister.” The respondents claim that, when the facts of the
case are considered together, it is clear that the lead respondent's relationship to her sister provided
at least one central reason for MS-13's threats and mistreatment. The respondents further contend
that the mistreatment, considered together, rises to the level of persecution. The respondents
therefore assert that their asylum application should be granted, or, in the alternative, the record
should be remanded for further proceedings.
I. FACTUAL ERRORS
The Immigration Judge's findings regarding what happened to the respondents and what
motivated their persecutors are factual findings that we review for clear error. 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 526, 532 (BIA 2011) (noting a persecutor's motive
for inflicting harm on an alien is a finding of fact). The respondents assert that the Immigration
Judge overlooked key testimony in making these findings. The record supports the respondents'
assertions.
A. Death Threat to Lead Respondent
First, the Immigration Judge made factual errors in discussing the threats to the lead respondent
(IJ at 5). The Immigration Judge stated that the lead respondent received two separate threatening
phone calls in 2015 shortly before she left El Salvador and that the second, anonymous call was
the only call that included a death threat to her (1J at 5). The lead respondent's testimony, her
written statement, and the timeline she submitted, however, show that she received only one
threatening phone call in April 2015 (Tr. at 53-55; Exh. 3, Tab A; Exh. 5). The lead respondent's
statements also establish that this phone call was from MS-13 members who had been threatening
her son and had taken his cell phone. Finally, contrary to the Immigration Judge's statements, the
lead respondent's testimony and statements indicate that, during the call, the gang members
threatened the lead respondent with death (IJ at 5; Tr. at 53-55; Exh. 3, Tab A; Exh. 5).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
After discussing the phone calls and threats to the lead respondent, the Immigration Judge
concluded that “there is not sufficient evidence to identify who made the (death] threat and whether
they would follow through with it" (IJ at 5). As noted above, however, the respondents' evidence
does contain sufficient information to establish that the death threat to the lead respondent was
2
In their brief on appeal, the respondents include a reference to a second threatening phone call
allegedly received by the lead respondent shortly before she and the minor respondent left El
Salvador. The respondents, however, have not included a citation to any testimony or evidence in
support of this reference (Respondent's Br. at 2, 6). The lead respondent's testimony and written
statement refer only to a phone call from Giovanni received in 2010 (Tr. at 38-42) and the phone
call received from the minor respondent's cell phone in April 2015 (Tr. at 53-55; Exh. 3, Tab A).
We therefore find no support in the record for either the Immigration Judge's or the respondents'
reference to a second threatening call in 2015.
2

1-901 et al.
made by the gang members who had been harassing, threatening, and beating the lead respondent's
children (Tr. at 54; Exh. 3, Tab A). The respondents' evidence also establishes that these gang
members had harmed the lead respondent's children and other relatives in the past (Tr. at 33-54;
Exh 3, Tabs A-D). The evidence therefore is sufficient to indicate that the gang members would
be likely to follow through with the threat. Accordingly, thc Immigration Judge's factual findings
relating to the death threat to the lead respondent are clearly erroneous.
B. Connection Between Incidents
The Immigration Judge's conclusion that MS-13's acts against the lead respondent's family
over the years were not connected also is clearly erroneous (IJ at 7-8). In reaching this conclusion,
the Immigration Judge overlooked key portions of the lead respondent's testimony linking the
gang's targeting of her sister and the respondent's children (IJ at 7-8). The lead respondent
testified that her sons became targets of the gang for recruitment because “they have always
targeted my family. They have always persecuted my family ever since all those things happened
to my sister” (Tr. at 49).
The lead respondent's account of the gang's threats and actions against her and her family
members supports this testimony. In particular, the lead respondent testified that a specific gang
member in her locality threatened her and her sons immediately after she retumed from her sister's
home (Tr. at 45). The gang member told them not to help or support the lead respondent's sister
or the gang would take one of the lead respondent's children (Tr. at 45). The lead respondent then
explained that members of this gang singled out her sons and harassed and threatened them at
school (Tr. at 49-54).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Under the current law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the circuit
in which the respondents' case arises, the lead respondent's testimony is sufficient show that
her relationship to her sister was at least one central reason for MS-13's targeting of both herself
and her children even in 2015 when the gang was attempting to recruit her sons. See Hernandez-
Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949-50 (4th Cir. 2015); Alvarez Lagos v. Barr, 927 F.3d 236, 250
(4th Cir. 2019) (emphasizing that it is enough if the particular social group it is at least one central
reason, perhaps intertwined with other central reasons, why the alien, and not another person, was
targeted).
The lead respondent's testimony also is sufficient to show that her relationship to the minor
respondent was at least one central reason for the death threat she received in April 2015 (IJ at 8).
Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d at 949-50 (finding that alien's relationship to her son was
why she, and not another person, was targeted by the gang); see also Alvarez Lagos v. Barr,
3 While the Immigration Judge's misunderstanding regarding who delivered a death threat to the
lead respondent and when this threat was made caused him to conclude that the respondents'
evidence was not sufficient to establish that the individuals making the threat were likely to carry
through with it, the Immigration Judge did, later in his decision, conclude that the lead respondent
had a well-founded fear of facing persecution in El Salvador (IJ at 5-6). The correct account of
the 2015 phone call further supports this conclusion.

927 F.3d at 250 (reiterating that the protected ground need not be the only reason or even the
dominant or primary reason). To the extent that the Immigration Judge made contrary factual
findings, the Immigration Judge's findings are clearly erroneous.
II. COGNIZABLE PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP
Having concluded that the lead respondent's evidence is sufficient to show that she was
targeted on account of her relationship to both her sister and her son, the key issue in her case
becomes whether “family members of her sister” and “family members of her son" are cognizable
particular social groups.
During her closing arguments, the lead respondent claimed that she was persecuted in El
Salvador on account of her membership in the particular social group of her family. The lead
respondent defined this group to include her children, her sister, who was like a mother to her, and
her sister's grandchildren (Tr. at 88). In his decision, the Immigration Judge separated this group
into two particular social groups: “family members of the lead respondent's sister” and “family
members of the lead respondent's son” (IJ at 6-7). The Immigration Judge found both groups
qualified as cognizable particular social groups (1J at 7).
The Fourth Circuit has long held that a family provides “a prototypical example of a particular
social group.” Crespin-Valladares v. Holder, 632 F.3d 117, 125 (4th Cir. 2011); see also
Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d at 949 (stating that membership in a nuclear family qualifies
as a protected ground for asylum purposes). The Immigration Judge's decision therefore was
consistent with controlling Fourth Circuit law. The Immigration Judge's decision also was
consistent with our precedent at that time. Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec, 40, 42-43 (BIA 2017).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
On July 29, 2019, however, while the respondents' appeal was pending, the Attorney General
published his decision in Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 581 (A.G. 2019). The decision overruled
our earlier recognition of L-E-A-'s immediate family as a cognizable particular social group.
Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. at 586-97. In doing so, the Attorney General stated that an asylum
applicant “must establish that his specific family group is defined with sufficient particularity and
is socially distinct in his society.” The Attorney General noted that “[i]n the ordinary case, a family
group will not meet that standard, because it will not have the kind of identifying characteristics
that render the family socially distinct within the society in question.” Id at 586.
The Attorney General's opinion represents a fundamental change in asylum law. Given the
facts and circumstances of this case, the parties therefore should be given an opportunity to address
whether Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. at 589-92, effectively supersedes the Fourth Circuit's
settled precedents regarding family as a particular social group; and, if so, whether any of the
family groups identified by the lead respondent still qualify as particular social groups under the
new legal framework. Accordingly, we remand the record to the Immigration Judge for further
proceedings.
In doing so, we note that we have not reached the respondents' arguments regarding past
persecution. When the correct facts regarding the death threat to the lead respondent are
considered, the lead respondent's past experiences appear to qualify as persecution under Fourth
4

-901 et al.
Circuit law. See Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949 (noting that the threat of death
qualifies as persecution); Zavaleta-Policiano v. Sessions, 873 F.3d 241, 245 and 247 (4th Cir.
2017) (finding past persecution where MS-13 threatened and extorted alien after her father left El
Salvador; MS-13 threatened to kill her children if she did not meet the gang's demands; and she
felt terrorized by the threats and fears for her safety and the safety of children). The Immigration
Judge, however, should revisit this issue if he determines that the respondents have identified a
cognizable particular social group. The Immigration Judge also, at that time, should address
whether the respondents have met their burden of establishing that the government of El Salvador
is unwilling or unable to protect them. Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 337 (A.G. 2018)
(indicating that, to establish that a government is unwilling and unable to provide protection, an
asylum applicant must show that the government condoned the private actions “or at least
demonstrated a complete helplessness to protect the victims”).
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

As we noted earlier, the Immigration Judge has already concluded that the lead respondent has
a well-founded fear of persecution in El Salvador (IJ at 5-6).
