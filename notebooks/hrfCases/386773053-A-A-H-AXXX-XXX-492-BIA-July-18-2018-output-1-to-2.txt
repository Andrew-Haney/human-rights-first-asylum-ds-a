IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Robert A. Free, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Autumn Cheramie
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondent, a native and citizen of Iraq and a member of the Kurdish minority, appeals
from an Immigration Judge's March 5, 2018, decision denying his motion to reopen proceedings
to apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16-1208.18. On
April 13, 2018, the Board accepted a brief from amici curiae, which submitted additional evidence.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed a response on April 23, 2018. The respondent
filed a brief and motion to remand on May 10, 2018. We will sustain the appeal and grant the
respondent's motion.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
Given the evidence of country conditions submitted by the respondent and amici curiae, and
the submission of an application for relief (Form 1-589) by the respondent, we find that the
respondent has established materially changed country conditions in Iraq with regard to his
application for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We therefore will sustain his
appeal and grant his motion to reopen. See 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.23(b)(4)(i); Matter of J-J-, 21 I&N
Dec. 976 (BIA 1997). We will remand the record for further proceedings.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and proceedings are reopened.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the
foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
