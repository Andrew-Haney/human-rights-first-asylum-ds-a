IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL AND MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Russell Arbutyn, Esquire
APPLICATION: Termination; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Iraq and a lawful permanent resident of the United
States, appeals the Immigration Judge's April 10, 2018, decision denying his applications for
withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Section
241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18. During the pendency of the appeal, the respondent filed a motion to
terminate proceedings based on new evidence, and subsequently filed an appellate brief,
accompanied by a renewed motion to terminate proceedings. The Department of Homeland
Security (“DHS”) did not respond to the original motion to terminate or to the renewed motion to
terminate proceedings. The motion will be granted, and the removal proceedings will be
terminated.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident on June 13, 1996
(Exh. 1). On April 5, 1999, the respondent was convicted in the 16th Circuit Court, Mount
Clemens, Michigan, for the offense of criminal sexual conduct in the fourth degree, committed in
violation of M.C.L. section 750.520E1A-A (Exh. 1). The respondent was subsequently charged
with removability as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude
committed within 5 years after admission for which a sentence of one year or longer may be
imposed, and as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43)(A)
of the Act, a law relating to sexual abuse of a minor), and (Exh. 1). See sections 237(a)(2)(A)(i)
and 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) and 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).
With his motion to terminate, the respondent has submitted new evidence that, on October 31,
2018, a Michigan court granted the prosecutor's oral motion to nolle prosequi the 1998 matter
nunc pro tunc, as well as the defendant's motion for entry of an order to nolle prosequi the matter
nunc pro tunc. The state court judge stated that the basis of the order was that the defendant (the
respondent in these proceedings) was “not properly advised of the possible immigration

consequences of his plea in this matter; resulting in ineffective assistance of counsel rendering his
plea unknowing and involuntary.” The Order of Nolle Prosequi was entered nunc pro tunc to
August 12, 1998 (Respondent’s Motion to Terminate, Exh. A). Because the state court judge
entered the order of nolle prosequi on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the
underlying criminal proceedings, the conviction is not valid for immigration purposes. Matter of
Adamiak, 23 I&N Dec. 878 (BIA 2006). As such, neither charge of removability can be sustained.
Thus, termination is appropriate.
In light of our disposition, we need not address the respondent's contentions on appeal
regarding his eligibility for relief. Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161, 170 (BIA 2013) (citing INS
v. Bagamasbad, 429 U.S. 24, 25-26 (1976) (stating that "courts and agencies are not required to
make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach”)).
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The motion to terminate is granted.
FURTHER ORDER: The removal proceedings are terminated.
