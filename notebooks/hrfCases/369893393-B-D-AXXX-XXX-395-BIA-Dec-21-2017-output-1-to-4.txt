In re: B
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Michael Lehach, Esquire
APPLICATION: Cancellation of removal; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mali, timely appeals an Immigration Judge's January 6,
2017, decision. The Immigration Judge found the respond removable as charged, denied his
applications for cancellation of removal pursuant to section 240A(b)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1229b, withholding of removal pursuant to section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3),
and protection under the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2), and
ordered the respondent removed. The respondent's request for oral argument before this Board is
denied. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e). On appeal, the respondent contests the denial of all three forms
of relief. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge
for required background checks.

The Board reviews an Immigration Judge's findings of fact, including credibility
determinations and the likelihood of future events, under a “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); Matter of 2-2-0-, 26 I&N Dec. 586 (BIA 2015). We review all other issues,
including questions of law, judgment, or discretion, under a de novo standard. 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
As to the respondent's application for cancellation of removal, the only issue in dispute is
whether the respondent has established that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely
unusual hardship to his three United States citizen children, who were ages 8 years, 7 years, and
3 months, respectively, at the time of the respondent's hearing (IJ at 2, 7; Exh. 3; Tr. at 22-23).
The principal hardship alleged by the respondent is the risk that his three United States citizen
daughters would be forced to undergo female genital mutilation (“FGM”), per the cultural
and religious beliefs of his family in Mali. In her decision, the Immigration Judge found that
“[i]f the respondent had established that his daughters would be subjected to FGM, the court
would have found that such a procedure clearly constitutes exceptional and extremely unusual
hardship, and that the respondent's removal from the U.S. would put his daughters in jeopardy if
they were to accompany him to Mali” (IJ at 8). However, she found that the respondent had not
established that he would be unable to protect his daughters from FGM (Id.). We find clear error
in the Immigration Judge's predictive finding, and will reverse it. See Hui Lin Huang v. Holder,
677 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2012) (holding that an Immigration Judge's determination as to the
likelihood of a future event occurring is a question of fact that we review for clear error); Matter of
Z-Z-0- at 586.

In this case the Immigration Judge found the respondent to be credible (IJ at 8). The respondent
testified that in his family, every girl is circumcised, without exception (Tr. at 25, 26). He stated
that he leamed in 2007 that his eldest daughter, who was born in and remains in Mali, was forcibly
circumcised in 2007, at age 4, against his express wishes and efforts (Tr. at 24-25, 38). Moreover,
this was done by the respondent's aunt, despite the efforts of his wife to block it (Tr. at 27). Due
to a difficult financial and living situation in the United States, the respondent sent his eldest
United States citizen daughter to live with his sister and her husband in Mali in 2009, where she
remained for 4 years, until 2013 (Tr. at 28, 51). He testified that he eventually called for his
daughter to be returned to him, as his sister's efforts to keep the respondent's daughter from being
circumcised were being thwarted, and the pressure from the respondent's family to circumcise his
daughter became too intense (Tr. at 53-54, 61-62). The respondent testified that he would not be
able to prevent his family members from coming for his daughters and circumcising them if they
were in Mali, as both he and his wife would need to work during the day and leave the children in
the care of someone else, and his family feels so strongly about the requirement that they be
circumcised (29-30, 31-32).
Given these uncontested factual findings, we are persuaded that the respondent's United States
citizen daughters would be at a high risk of being forcibly circumcised at the behest of his family,
and will reverse the Immigration Judge's finding to the contrary. Notably, the respondent's eldest
daughter was in fact circumcised against his wishes, and he was only able to avoid having his
second daughter circumcised by placing her in the custody of his sister, who, like him, objected to
the procedure and undertook efforts to keep her from the respondent's family. Even then, once it
became too risky to have her remain in Mali, the respondent called for his sister to send her back
to the United States. Finally, given that the respondent's eldest daughter was taken away to be
circumcised by the respondent's aunt unbeknownst to the respondent and his wife, and the
respondent credibly testified that she or another family member would likely do the same with his
other children while he and his wife were at work if they returned to Mali, we find that the
likelihood of his daughters undergoing FGM would be significant if the respondent were removed
to Mali and his wife (who is also a native and citizen of Mali) and daughters followed him there,
and that such risk constitutes exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to them. As the
respondent has met the other statutory requirements for cancellation of removal, and in the absence
of evidence that would warrant a negative exercise of discretion, we will reverse the Immigration
Judge's denial of cancellation of removal, and remand for required background checks.
