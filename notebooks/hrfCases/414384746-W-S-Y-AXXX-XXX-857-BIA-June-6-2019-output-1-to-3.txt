IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Thelma O. Garcia, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Mark R. Whitworth
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum
The respondent, a native and citizen of China, appeals the Immigration Judge's
December 13, 2017, decision denying his application for asylum.' Section 208(b)(1)(A) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A). The Department of Homeland
Security (“DHS”) opposes the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be
remanded for the completion of background and security checks.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the "clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We
review all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo
standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The Immigration Judge denied the respondent's application for asylum because the
respondent did not file his application within 1 year of his entry into the United States (IJ at 7).
See section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act. The respondent argues on appeal that extraordinary
circumstances excuse his late-filed asylum application. See section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act;
8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5). He first raised this argument during his first hearing before the
Immigration Judge on October 17, 2016 (Tr. at 3-4).
In order to have omplied with the 1-year deadline for asylum, the respondent would have
had to file his application by October 2015. Prior to September 14, 2016, asylum applications
for individuals in removal proceedings had to be filed in open court at a master calendar hearing.
See Immigration Court Practice Manual, Chapter 3.1(b)(iii)(A) (June 10, 2013); see also
Operating Policies and Procedures Memorandum 16-01: Filing Applications for Asylum at 2
(September 14, 2016) (stating that effective immediately, asylum applications no longer need to
be filed at a master calendar hearing and can be filed by mail or at the Immigration Court
| The Immigration Judge's grant of the respondent's application for withholding of removal and
his denial of the respondent's application for protection under the Convention Against Torture
are not challenged on appeal.

window). The respondent, who has been in removal proceedings since December 2014, did not
have a hearing before the Immigration Court prior to the October 2015 deadline (IJ at 1-2;
Exh. 1). The record indicates that the respondent filed a motion on August 18, 2015, requesting
the Immigration Court schedule a hearing so that he could apply for asylum before
October 2015. The Immigration Court, however, never responded to this motion. The
respondent's first hearing before the Immigration Court was October 17, 2016, approximately
2 years after his October 2014 entry into the United States (IJ at 1-2; Exh. 1). This constitutes
extraordinary circumstances directly related to the respondent's failure to file a timely
application for asylum. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5)
The record further establishes that the respondent filed for asylum within a reasonable period
given these extraordinary circumstances. See id. The procedure for filing for asylum changed
on September 14, 2016, to allow filings outside of master calendar hearings. See Operating
Policies and Procedures Memorandum 16-01: Filing Applications for Asylum at 2
(September 14, 2016). The respondent filed his application on October 26, 2016, 9 days after his
initial removal hearing (IJ at 2; Exh. 3). In these particular circumstances, we consider an
approximately 6-week delay a reasonable period of time. See Matter of T-M-H- & S-W-C-,
25 I&N Dec. 193, 195 (BIA 2010) (noting that filing delays must be evaluated in relation to the
particular circumstances involved). Therefore, the respondent is not time-barred from applying
for asylum.

The DHS does not appeal the Immigration Judge's grant of the respondent's application for
withholding of removal. Because the respondent has satisfied the higher burden of proof for
withholding of removal, it follows that he has satisfied the lower burden for asylum. See
INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 423-24 (1987) (holding that the "well-founded fear"
standard for asylum is less than the “clear probability" standard for withholding of removal).
The record does not contain any evidence warranting a discretionary denial of the respondent's
application for asylum. See Matter of Pula, 19 I&N Dec. 467, 474 (BIA 1987) (noting that the
danger of persecution will generally outweigh all but the most egregious of adverse factors).
Therefore, we conclude that the respondent is eligible for asylum. However, we will remand the
record to the Immigration Judge for the DHS to conduct the required background checks. See
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(6)(ii)(A); see also Matter of Alcantara-Perez, 23 I&N Dec. 882, 884-85
(BIA 2006). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained and the Immigration Judge's December 13,
2017, decision is vacated to the extent it denies the respondent's application for asylum.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(6), the record is remanded to the
Immigration Judge for the purpose of allowing the DHS the opportunity to complete or update
identity, law enforcement, or security investigations or examinations, and further proceedings, if
necessary, and for the entry of an order as provided by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.47(h).
