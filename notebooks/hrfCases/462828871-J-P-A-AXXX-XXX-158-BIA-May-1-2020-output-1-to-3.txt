In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gino Mario Mesa, Esquire
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal
The respondent is a native and citizen of El Salvador. He appeals from the May 23, 2018,
decision of an Immigration Judge, which denied his application for withholding of removal as
abandoned, but granted a period of voluntary departure. Sections 240B(b) and 241(b)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1229c(b); 1231(b)(3). The respondent filed a brief
concerning the decision of the Immigration Judge, while the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained, and the case will be
remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The Immigration Judge concluded that the application for withholding of removal was
abandoned because the respondent failed to comply with biometrics security checks (IJ at 2-3).
An Immigration Judge may deem certain applications for relief (including withholding of
removal) abandoned for failure of the applicant to have fingerprints taken or otherwise complete
the biometrics requirement. See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.47(a)-(d). In Matter of D-M-C-P-,
26 I&N Dec. 644 (BIA 2015), we discussed the procedural prerequisites for such an order.
Specifically, in order to conclude that an applicant has abandoned his application for relief by
failing to complete certain biometric requirements, the Immigration Judge “should do all of the
following on the record: (1) ensure that the DHS has advised the applicant of the need to provide
biometrics and other biographical information and has furnished the appropriate instructions;
(2) inform the applicant of the deadline for complying with the requirements of which he has been
notified, and (3) inform the applicant of the consequences of noncompliance, including the
possibility that the application will be deemed abandoned and dismissed, unless the failure to
comply resulted from good cause.” Id. at 649.
The record supports the conclusion that the Immigration Judge did not provide adequate on-
the-record instructions and advisals concerning the necessity of completing the biometrics
requirement, as required by regulation and Matter of D-M-C-P-, 26 I&N Dec. at 649.

At the July 11, 2017, hearing, the Immigration Judge did not provide the respondent with
information conceming the consequences of noncompliance, including the possibility that the
application could be deemed abandoned and dismissed, unless the failure to comply resulted from
good cause. Id.
At the final May 23, 2018, removal hearing, the Immigration Judge did not set forth on the
record the circumstances concerning the respondent's noncompliance with the biometrics
requirement, and did not provide the respondent an opportunity to argue that failure to comply
resulted from good cause (Tr. at 14-18).'
Accordingly, pursuant to Matter of D-M-C-P-, we will sustain the respondent's appeal and
remand this record for the Immigration Judge to reissue the biometrics instructions, provide a
deadline by which the respondent must provide required biometric information, and provide the
requisite advisals regarding abandonment.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with this order.

| The Immigration Judge says in her decision that at the May 23, 2018, hearing the DHS informed
her that fingerprints had not been taken; the respondent could not provide proof that biometrics
were requested, and the respondent did not show that there was good cause for the failure to comply
with the biometrics requirement (IJ at 2-3). Any such discussion is not included in the transcript
of proceedings for the May 23, 2018, removal hearing.
