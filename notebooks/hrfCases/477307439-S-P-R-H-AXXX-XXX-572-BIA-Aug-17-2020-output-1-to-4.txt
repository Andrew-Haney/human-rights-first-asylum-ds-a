APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT: Murray D. Hilts, Esquire
APPLICATION: Deferral of removal
The applicant, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge's decision
dated March 29, 2018. In that decision, the Immigration Judge found the applicant ineligible for
withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1231(b)(3), or pursuant to the Convention Against Torture.' The Immigration Judge also denied
the applicant's application for deferral of removal pursuant to the Convention Against Torture.
The appeal will be dismissed in part and sustained in part, and the record will be remanded for
further proceedings consistent with this order.

We review an Immigration Judge's factual determinations, including credibility
determinations, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). The Board uses a de novo standard
of review for questions of law, discretion, judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions
of Immigration Judges. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). The applicant bears the burden of
establishing that she is eligible for, and deserving of, all relief sought. See section 240(c)(4) of the
Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(d).
The Immigration Judge pretermitted the applicant's application for withholding of removal,
finding that she was barred from this form of relief because she had been convicted of trafficking
in methamphetamine under section 11379 of the California Health and Safety Code, and that this
conviction constitutes an aggravated felony and a “particularly serious crime” (IJ at 3-5). Section
241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act. The Immigration Judge found that the applicant did not carry her
burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that this offense did not qualify as a particularly
serious crime ((IJ at 4-5) (citing Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002)).
The applicant challenges these findings on appeal, and also argues that the Immigration Judge
should have granted her application for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture,
given the record evidence of her past torture at the hands of a member of a dangerous Mexican
drug cartel. Applicant's Br. at 6-13, 20-22.
On appeal, the applicant argues that the Immigration Judge erred in finding her conviction to
be an aggravated felony drug trafficking crime, and by applying the rebuttable presumption in
Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R-, 23 I&N Dec. 270 (A.G. 2002) to find that her offense is a
particularly serious crime. A conviction arising under section 11379 of the California Health and

Safety Code is not categorically an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act,
because the statute punishes solicitation offenses as well as trafficking offenses. Applicant's Br. at
6-8. We agree. In Sandoval-Lua v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d 1121, 1127-28 (9th Cir. 2007), the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that section 11379(a) of the California Health
and Safety Code is a divisible statute that encompasses offenses that both do and do not constitute
an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(43)(B) of the Act. See Sandoval-Lua v. Gonzales,
499 F.3d at 1128. Although the Immigration Judge conducted a modified categorical analysis of
the record of conviction and determined that the applicant's offense involved trafficking (IJ at 4),
the record does not support this factual finding. The indictment in particular, count 3 to which
the applicant pled guilty) largely tracks the language of the statute, which would include
solicitation offenses that are not "drug trafficking crimes.” See Nath v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 1185
(9th Cir. 2006). The Immigration Judge's reliance on the applicant's plea, in which she admitted
that she "offered to sell” methamphetamine, does not provide adequate evidence to support a
finding that the applicant's offense is a “drug trafficking” aggravated felony. See U.S.
v. Rivera-Sanchez, 247 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir. 2001); Leyva-Licea v. INS, 187 F.3d 1147, 1150
(9th Cir. 1999) (finding “offer to sell” is solicitation). Therefore, applying a modified categorical
analysis, the record and the facts found by the Immigration Judge do not support a finding that the
applicant was convicted of an aggravated felony.
Given this, an analysis under Matter of Y-L-, A-G- & R-S-R-, does not govern the resolution of
the question whether the applicant's conviction constitutes a “particularly serious crime,” and the
rebuttable presumption that her offense is dangerous does not apply. A particularly serious crime
need not be an aggravated felony. Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336, 338-40 (BIA 2007)
abrogated on other grounds by Flores-Vega v. Barr, 932 F.3d 878 (9th Cir. 2019).2 Rather, we
consider whether the applicant's offense is particularly serious in the context of an analysis of
whether the crime is dangerous. See Matter of G-G-S-, 26 I&N Dec. 339, 342 (BIA 2014). In
determining whether the applicant's conviction constitutes a “particularly serious crime” that poses
a "danger to the community of the United States,” we consider an Immigration Judge's findings
on the nature of the conviction, the sentence imposed, and the circumstances and underlying facts
of the offense. See Matter of Frentescu, 18 I&N Dec. 244, 247 (BIA 1982), modified on other
grounds by Matter of C-, 20 I&N Dec. 529 (BIA 1992); Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 342;
Delgado v. Holder, 648 F.3d at 1106-07.

In this matter, the Immigration Judge found without clear error that the applicant was convicted
for being involved as an interpreter in a transaction involving the sale of approximately one
kilogram of methamphetamine, worth potentially thousands of dollars (IJ at 5). But the record
lacks other detailed findings about the applicant's role in the offense, the sentence she received,
and the nature of the offense, that are necessary to reach a conclusion as to whether the applicant's
offense is a particularly serious crime pursuant to Matter of Frentescu. We accordingly will

The Ninth Circuit has deferred to the Board's framework for considering when a conviction
constitutes a particularly serious crime and has also recognized that such crimes are not limited to
a statutorily-defined aggravated felonies. Delgado V. Holder, 648 F.3d 1095, 1102-06
(9th Cir. 2011); see section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act.

remand the record for the Immigration Judge to further consider the applicant's eligibility for
withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Act, to include whether the “particularly
serious crime” bar applies to her application for this relief.
Turning to the application for deferral of removal pursuant to the Convention Against Torture,
which was based on the applicant's fear of future torture from the drug cartel member who
assaulted and tortured her some 25 years ago, we will affirm the Immigration Judge's denial of
this relief for the reasons set forth in her decision (IJ at 5-11). Given the passage of a significant
period of time, we discern no clear error the Immigration Judge's finding that the applicant has not
submitted evidence that establishes a clear probability that she would be singled out for torture in
the future by the member of the drug cartel who severely abused and mistreated her in the past
(Id. at 9). Ridore v. Holder, 696 F.3d 907 (9th Cir. 2012). We affirm as lacking clear error the
Immigration Judge's finding that the applicant has not submitted evidence that establishes a clear
probability that she would be harmed by persons acting with the consent or acquiescence of the
government (Id. at 10). Garcia-Milian v. Holder, 755 F.3d 1026, 1034 (9th Cir. 2014) (general
ineffectiveness in preventing or investigating criminal activities does not raise an inference that
public officials are likely to acquiesce in torture). Therefore, the applicant is unable to prove her
eligibility for relief under the Convention Against Torture.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The applicant's appeal of the Immigration Judge's denial of her application for
protection under the Convention Against Torture is dismissed.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
FURTHER ORDER: The applicant's appeal of the denial of her application for withholding of
removal under the Act is sustained, and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this order.
