IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Thomas G. Knox, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondents, natives and citizens of El Salvador, appeal from the September 21, 2017,
Immigration Judge's decision denying their applications for asylum and withholding of removal
under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158,
1231(b)(3), and for protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16-
1208.18. The appeal will be sustained, and the record will be remanded.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, ncluding issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(a)(3)(ii).
At the hearing on September 21, 2017, the lead respondent testified concerning her fear of
retuming to El Salvador. In 2001, when she was pregnant with the second respondent, her husband
was fatally shot by gang members. She stated that she thought that the gang members may have
killed her husband because they mistakenly believed that he owned the land where he worked
tending cattle, although the land belonged to his brother. In 2014, the lead respondent's family
home was invaded by armed gang members, who left a message with her mother-in law that they
would burn down the residence with everyone inside if the lead respondent did not surrender her
son, the second respondent, to join their gang (Exhs. 2, 3 at 28-29; IJ at 4-5; Tr. at 18-27, 34-36,
45-48). The second respondent testified consistently with his mother (Tr. at 65-74). The lead
respondent indicated that she was unaware of any connection between the 2001 and 2014 incidents,
and the second respondent noted that he was not familiar with the circumstances of his father's
2001 death because he was not bom yet (IJ at 5-6; Tr. at 35-36, 73). The Immigration Judge found
that both respondents were credible (Tr. at 4). There is no clear error in the Immigration Judge's
findings of fact.
The Immigration Judge concluded that the lead respondent had established past harm rising to
the level of persecution in that gang members had invaded the family home and threatened to burn
it down while occupied (IJ at 6). See Liv. Gonzales, 405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir. 2005) (discussing
the meaning of the term “persecution” under the Act). However, the Immigration Judge denied

1-985 et al.
the lead respondent's application for asylum after determining that she had not shown that the past
harm was on account of her race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a
particular social group (IJ at 6-7). See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478,481 (1992); Velasquez
v. Sessions, 866 F.3d 188, 193-94 (4th Cir. 2017).
We disagree. Although the gang members targeted the second respondent for the purpose of
recruitment, the gang members targeted the lead respondent for harm because of her actions as a
mother who sought to prevent her son, the second respondent, from joining the gang. The record
therefore establishes that at least one central reason why the lead respondent suffered past
persecution in El Salvador was her membership in a particular social group, specifically her
nuclear family. See Hernandez-Avalos v. Lynch, 784 F.3d 944, 949-50 (4th Cir. 2015).
Although the lead respondent has demonstrated that she suffered past persecution in El
Salvador on account of a ground protected under the Act, she must also show that the govemment
of El Salvador is unwilling or unable to control the gang members who have threatened her. See
id. at 950-53. “Whether a govemment is unable or unwilling to control private actors is a factual
question that must be resolved based on the record in each case.” Id. at 951 (quotations and citation
omitted). If the respondent is found to have met this burden, she shall be presumed to have a well-
founded fear of persecution on the basis of the same claim, and therefore to be eligible for asylum,
unless the Department of Homeland Security demonstrates the existence of at least one of certain
conditions. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1). We therefore will remand the record to allow the
Immigration Judge to conduct appropriate fact-finding and analysis with regard to these points.

Accordingly, we enter the following orders.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
