IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Pro se
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Matthew S. Gabe
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION:
Asylum, withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; remand
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from an Immigration Judge's decision
dated April 30, 2018, denying his applications for withholding of removal under section
241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), and for protection
under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18. The respondent has also
filed a motion to remand to apply for asylum. The record will be remanded.

We review findings of fact determined by an Immigration Judge, including credibility findings,
under a "clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo questions
of law, discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from decisions of
Immigration Judges. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
On appeal, the respondent urges that pursuant to Mendez Rojas v. Johnson, 305 F. Supp.3d
1176 (W.D. Wash. 2018), he should be permitted to pursue his asylum application notwithstanding
his delay in filing it (Respondent's Notice of Mendez Rojas Class Membership). The Department
of Homeland Security (DHS) argues that the respondent has not submitted evidence of his
membership in the Mendez Rojas class (DHS's Opposition to Motion to Hold Briefing and Appeal
in Abeyance”). We disagree. The respondent has submitted a copy of an 1-826, indicating that he
was released from DHS custody after he was deemed to have a credible fear of persecution. The
DHS did not address this submission in its most recent filing. Accordingly, pursuant to orders
entered in the above-noted class action litigation, we conclude that a remand of this record is
required to permit the Immigration Judge an opportunity to determine if the respondent is a
designated class member under Mendez-Rojas. See Mendez Rojas v. Nielsen, No. 2:16-cv-01024-
RSM, Interim Stay Agreement at 1-2 (W.D. Wash. July 17, 2018). If the Immigration Judge
determines that the respondent is a class member and that he should be permitted an opportunity
to have his asylum application considered, the Immigration Judge should render a decision on that
application based on the evidence of record. In the event that it is deemed necessary by the
Immigration Judge, the parties should be permitted to introduce additional evidence bearing on the
issue on remand.
A remand is also warranted for the Immigration Judge to reevaluate the respondent's
application for withholding of removal. Specifically, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Cite as: H-R-M-, AXXX XXX 581 (BIA July 2, 2020)
-581
Ninth Circuit, in whose jurisdiction this case arises, has held that the “one central reason” nexus
standard that is applicable in asylum proceedings, is not applicable to an alien's claim for
withholding of removal. Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d 351, 360 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding
that “a reason” is a less demanding standard than the “one central reason” test and that “a reason”
is the correct standard to be applied to withholding of removal claims).
Here, the Immigration Judge relied solely on the “one central reason” asylum analysis in
denying the respondent's application for withholding of removal (IJ at 6-8). For instance, the
Immigration Judge found that the respondent's family membership was not at least one central
reason for his past experience with the gang (IJ at 8). However, the Immigration Judge did not
find whether respondent's family membership could be a reason” for his past and feared future
harm for withholding of removal purposes under the Barajas-Romero standard.
Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d at 360. Therefore, the Immigration Judge's decision is
incomplete with respect to the withholding of removal claim. Such a determination requires fact-
finding, which is not our function. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv); Matter of N-M-, 25 I&N Dec.
526, 532 (BIA 2011) (stating that the motive of a persecutor is a finding of fact to be determined
by the Immigration Judge and reviewed for clear error). We conclude that further factual
development and legal analysis are needed with regard to the respondent's withholding of removal
claim under the standards applicable in the Ninth Circuit. Barajas-Romero v. Lynch, 846 F.3d
at 351. Therefore, we will remand the record to the Immigration Judge for supplemental fact-
finding and for the entry of a new decision that more fully addresses the merits of the respondent's
eligibility for withholding of removal. We express no opinion regarding the ultimate outcome of
these removal proceedings. See Matter of L-O-G-, 21 I&N Dec.413 (BIA 1996).

Accordingly, the following order shall be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
