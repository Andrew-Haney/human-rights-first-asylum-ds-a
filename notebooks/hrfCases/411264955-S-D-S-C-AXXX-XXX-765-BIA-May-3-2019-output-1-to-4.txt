IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Brenda A. Cisneros Vilchis, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Peter J. Marché
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of the Philippines, appeals from an Immigration Judge's
October 15, 2018, decision denying her applications for withholding of removal under section
241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), and protection pursuant
to the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c)-1208.18.' The appeal will be
sustained and the record will be remanded.

This Board reviews the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including credibility findings
and predictions as to the likelihood of future events, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(2)(3)(i).
We review all other issues de novo. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The record supports the Immigration Judge's determination that on January 20, 2017, the
respondent was convicted of bail jumping—underlying offense theft by unlawful taking in the
third degree for which a sentence of 3 years of imprisonment may be imposed—in violation of
N.J.S.A. § 2C:29-7, with a maximum sentence of 2 years or more of imprisonment (IJ at 1-2, 6;
Tr. at 19-21; Exhs. 1-1A; Exh. 2; Exh. 3, Tab C). We also will not disturb the Immigration Judge's
finding that on December 27, 2017, the respondent was convicted of bail jumping in the third
degree pursuant to N.Y.P.L. $ 215.55, and sentenced to 6 months of incarceration (IJ at 5-6; Tr. at
41; Exh. 2).
The respondent argues that the Immigration Judge erroneously concluded that her bail jumping
convictions were for particularly serious crimes barring her from receiving withholding of removal
under section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act considering the nature of the convictions, the
| The respondent does not dispute that she is ineligible for asylum on the basis of the time bar of
section 208(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B) (1J at 3 n.2). Likewise, the respondent
has not challenged the Immigration Judge's ruling that she is ineligible for asylum pursuant to the
particularly serious crime bar of section 208(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act due to her conviction for an
aggravated felony, as defined in section 101(a)(43)(T) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(T)
(IJ at 6 n.3; Tr. at 11-12). See section 208(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act.

sentences imposed, and the facts underlying the convictions (Respondent's Br. at 5-6).
See Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 336, 342 (BIA 2007); see also Nethagani v. Mukasey,
532 F.3d 150, 155 (2d Cir. 2008). We agree.
In relevant part, the New Jersey bail jumping statute provides:
A person set at liberty by court order, without or without bail, or who has been
issued a summons, upon condition that he will subsequently appear at a specified
time and place in connection with any offense or any violation of law punishable
by a period of incarceration, commits an offense if, without lawful excuse, he fails
to appear at that time and place.
N.J.S.A. § 2C:29-7. Furthermore, the New York bail jumping statute states:
A person is guilty of bail jumping in the third degree when by court order he has
been released from custody or allowed to remain at liberty, either upon bail or upon
his own recognizance, upon condition that he will subsequently appear personally
in connection with a criminal action or proceedings, and when he does not appear
personally on the required date or voluntarily within thirty days thereafter.
N.Y.P.L. § 215.55.
We conclude that the elements of these offenses potentially bring them within the ambit of
particularly serious crimes. See Malter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N Dec. at 342. In this regard, we
acknowledge the Immigration Judge's reasoning that bail jumping conveys an inherent disregard
for a court's authority (IJ at 7). At the same time, the offenses require no serious threat to others.
Cf. id. at 343 (alien found convicted of a particularly serious crime where the relevant Colorado
menacing statute required using, or representing that one was armed with, a deadly weapon and
knowingly placing or attempting to place another person in fear of imminent, serious bodily
injury). The respondent further testified that she committed the New Jersey offense because she
could not obtain transportation to her sentencing hearing while living in New York, and she
committed the New York offense because she could not control her drug addiction (IJ at 6; Tr. at
69-70, 78). Although we do not suggest that these facts underlying the respondent's bail jumping
convictions excuse her criminal conduct, the facts do not indicate that her crimes rose to the level
of “particularly serious.” See id. at 342. Finally, we disagree with the Immigration Judge's finding
that it is significant that the respondent committed other criminal offenses after jumping bail, as
factors which are subsequent and unrelated to the bail jumping offenses are not germane to whether
bail jumping itself is a particularly serious crime (IJ at 6-7). See id. at 343. For these reasons, we
reverse per our de novo review the Immigration Judge's ruling that the respondent's bail jumping
convictions were for particularly serious crimes which bar her from receiving withholding of
removal under section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act.

The respondent asserts that she has otherwise demonstrated eligibility for withholding of
removal (Respondent's Br. at 8-11). We will remand the record for the Immigration Judge to
consider this question as a matter of first impression. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (the Board
may remand when additional fact-finding is required in a given case).

Moreover, in light of our foregoing rulings, we reverse per our de novo review the
Immigration Judge's holding that the respondent is ineligible for withholding of removal under
the Convention Against Torture pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(d)(2) (IJ at 9-10). On remand, the
Immigration Judge should determine in the first instance the respondent's eligibility for
withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. ſ 1208.16(c).
The Immigration Judge may take whatever action he deems necessary to comply with our
order. We express no opinion as to the ultimate outcome of the case.
Accordingly, the following order is entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained and the record is remanded for the entry of a new decision
consistent with this opinion.
