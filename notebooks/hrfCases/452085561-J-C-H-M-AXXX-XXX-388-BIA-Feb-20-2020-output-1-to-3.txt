IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Vivian L. Canals, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondent, a native and citizen of Honduras, appeals from the Immigration Judge's
June 24, 2019, decision denying his motion to reopen. The appeal will be sustained and the record
will be remanded,
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgement, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The respondent was ordered removed in absentia on July 16, 2008 (IJ at 1). On April 12, 2019,
he filed a motion to reopen and rescind his in absentia removal order (IJ at 1). The Department of
Homeland Security (“DHS”) filed an opposition to the motion, and the Immigration Judge denied
the motion on May 15, 2019 (IJ at 1).
On May 28, 2019, the respondent filed a second motion to reopen. This motion was based on
a claim of changed country conditions and the respondent sought to apply for asylum and related
relief. The DHS again opposed the motion (IJ at 1). On June 24, 2019, the Immigration Judge
denied the respondent's second motion to reopen and this appeal followed (IJ at 1-2).
We will remand the record for further consideration of the respondent’s motion to reopen. The
Immigration Judge denied the respondent's motion for two reasons. First, the Immigration Judge
concluded that the motion was number-barred under 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) because it was the
respondent's second motion to reopen (IJ at 1). Second, the Immigration Judge concluded that the
motion "simply repeat[ed] the same arguments from his prior motion to reopen” (IJ at 2). In what
may have been a typographical error, the Immigration Judge also incorrectly described the
respondent's second motion as a motion to reconsider (IJ at 2).
Ordinarily, a party may only file one motion to reopen proceedings and that motion must be
filed within 90 days after entry of the final administrative order of removal. See section
240(c)(7)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(C)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.23(b)(1). But the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen do not apply if the
basis of the motion is to apply for asylum and related relief and is based on changed country
conditions arising in the country of nationality, if such evidence is material and was not available
and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding. See section

240(c)(7)(C)(ii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(i); see also Mailer of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 161,
163 (BIA 2013) (holding that the numerical limitations on filing a motion to reopen in 8 C.F.R.
§ 1003.23(b)(1) are not applicable to an alien seeking reopening to apply for asylum and
withholding of removal based on changed country conditions). We therefore conclude that the
Immigration Judge improperly determined that the respondent's motion to reopen was numerically
barred.
We also disagree with the Immigration Judge that the second motion repeats the arguments of
the first motion. Although some of the arguments are the similiar, such as the respondent's request
for sua sponte reopening, the second motion argues changed country conditions in Honduras for
the first time. The Immigration Judge did not address this issue. We will therefore remand the
record for the Immigration Judge to further consider the respondent's motion to reopen based on
changed country conditions. See Matter of J-G-, 26 I&N Dec. at 163 (holding that an alien who
is subject to an in absentia removal order need not first rescind the order before seeking reopening
of the proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed country
conditions)
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
