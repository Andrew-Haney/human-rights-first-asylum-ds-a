IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL AND MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Etan Z. Newman, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Justin Price
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; termination of
proceedings; remand
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge's decision
dated September 5, 2018, which denied her application for asylum and withholding of removal
under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158,
1231(b)(3), and protection under the Convention Against Torture, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c). The
parties have provided arguments on appeal. While the appeal was pending, the respondent filed a
motion to terminate proceedings pursuant to Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2015 (2018), with an
altemate motion to remand. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opposed the motion to
terminate proceedings but did not address the specifics of the motion to remand. The motion to
terminate proceedings will be denied, and the record will be remanded.

In the motion to terminate proceedings, the respondent argues that jurisdiction did not vest
with the Immigration Court because the Notice to Appear (NTA) did not designate the specific
time and date of the respondent’s removal proceedings. Respondent’s Br. in Support of Motion to
Terminate at 11. In Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. at 2108, the Supreme Court held that “[a]
putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's
removal proceedings is not a ‘notice to appear under (section 239(a) of the Act] section 1229(a),'
and does not trigger the stop-time rule" for purposes of cancellation of removal under sections
240A(a), (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I&N Dec.
441 (BIA 2018), we denied the alien's motion to terminate his removal proceedings based on
Pereira v. Sessions, holding that a notice to appear that does not specify the time and place of an
alien's initial hearing vests an Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings
and meets the requirements of section 239(a) of the Act, so long as a notice of hearing specifying
this information is later sent to the alien.

Proceedings before the Immigration Judge in this matter were completed in this location with
the respondent appearing through video conference. See section 240(b)(2)(A)(iii) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii).

As in Matter of Bermudez-Cota, the respondent here was personally served a notice to appear
on April 25, 2018 (Exh. 1). Although the notice to appear did not specify the time and date of the
respondent's initial hearing, she was later sent a notice of hearing indicating that she should appear
before the Immigration Judge on May 3, 2018, at 1:00 p.m. The respondent, in turn, appeared
before the Immigration Judge as scheduled (Tr. at 1-9).2 Notwithstanding the respondent's
argument that Matter of Bermudez-Cota was wrongly decided (Respondent's Br. in Support of
Motion to Terminate at 12), it is binding precedent in this matter. Matter of E-L-H-, 23 I&N Dec.
814, 817 (BIA 2005). Therefore, the NTA here is not defective, and the motion to terminate
proceedings will be denied.
However, we will grant the respondent's motion to remand. The record shows that during
proceedings before the Immigration Judge the respondent was unrepresented and detained. 3
During proceedings, she mentioned depression and anxiety, but there was no particular evidence
that the respondent was not competent to represent herself to warrant a full inquiry into her
competency. See Matter of M-A-M-, 25 I&N Dec. 474,477, 479 (BIA 2011).
The respondent, now represented by counsel, argues that she is a likely class member under
the Franco-Gonzalez class action settlement and requests a remand for a competency
determination. Respondent's Br. in Support of Motion to Terminate at 12-16. Under Franco-
Gonzalez v. Holder, No. CV-10-02211, 2014 WL 5475097 (C.D. Cal. 2014), Main Class Members
are all individuals who, among other requirements, meet at least one of the following criteria:
a. A Qualified Mental Health Provider (QMHP) determines that the respondent:
i. Has a mental disorder that is causing serious limitations in communication,
memory, or general mental and/or intellectual functioning; or
ii. Has a severe medical condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury or dementia) that
is significantly impairing mental function; or
iii. Is exhibiting one or more of the following active psychiatric symptoms or
behaviors: severe disorganization, active hallucinations or delusions, mania,
catatonia, severe depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and/or behavior,
marked anxiety or impulsivity; OR
b. A QMHP otherwise diagnoses the respondent as demonstrating significant
symptoms of:
i. Psychosis or Psychotic Disorder;
ii. Bipolar Disorder;
iii. Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder;
iv. Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features;
v. Dementia and/or a Neurocognitive Disorder; or
vi. Intellectual Development Disorder (moderate, severe, or profound); OR

We acknowledge that an attomey entered an appearance on the respondent's behalf on
August 20, 2018. However, on August 29, 2018, the attomey filed a motion to withdraw, which
the Immigration Judge granted on August 30, 2018.

c.
An Immigration Judge has a bona fide doubt about the respondent's competence
to represent him- or herself based upon the evidence of record.
In support of the motion, the respondent cited testimony and her swom statement to DHS in
which she related she had a mental illness (Tr. at 12,58; Exh. 4 at 18). Respondent's Br. in Support
of Motion to Terminate at 15-16. She also submitted medical records dated in April 2018 and
May 2018 that reflect symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia; diagnoses of major
depressive disorder, moderate, and unspecified anxiety disorder; and prescriptions for two
different medications. Respondent's Br. in Support of Motion to Terminate, Exh. B. Her personal
statement recounts a history of multiple abusive or traumatic situations and ill effects of her
medications. Respondent’s Br. in Support of Motion to Terminate. Exh. A. Although the
respondent does not have one of the precise diagnoses listed above, the reported symptoms and
limitations on functioning may satisfy Franco-Gonzalez Main Class requirements.
Although the respondent was detained and unrepresented, the record shows that the
Immigration Judge conducted a fair hearing and made a reasonable decision based on the evidence
before her at the time. However, under the current circumstances, where the respondent is now
represented and counsel has submitted new evidence of possible Franco-Gonzalez class
membership, we find it prudent to afford the respondent the opportunity to present her case. We
are thus required to remand the case to the Immigration Judge for all necessary factfinding and
analysis. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(iv). Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.

ORDER: The respondent's motion to terminate proceedings is denied.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with the foregoing opinion.
