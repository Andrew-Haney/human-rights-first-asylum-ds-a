In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Billy Jackson, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Haiti, appeals from the Immigration Judge's April 19,
2018, decision deeming abandoned the respondent's applications for asylum and withholding of
removal under sections 208 and 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.
$$ 1158, 1231(b)(3), as well as his request for protection under the Convention Against Torture,
8 C.F.R. $ 1208.16(c). See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.13, 1208.16-.18. The appeal will be sustained, and
the record will be remanded.
This Board defers to the Immigration Judge's factual findings, including credibility findings,
unless they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other issues,
including issues of law, discretion, and judgment. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent's applications for relief were abandoned
on account of the respondent's failure to meet the fingerprint and biometrics requirements (IJ at
2-3). See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1003.47(a)-(d). The respondent appeals this decision, arguing that he was
not properly advised about the biometrics requirements (Respondent's Br. at 4).
To determine whether an alien has abandoned his application for relief based on the failure to
comply with the biometrics filing requirement, the record must demonstrate that the alien received
proper notice of those requirements. Matter of D-M-C-P-, 26 I&N Dec. 644, 648-49 (BIA 2015).
Proper notice requires that (1) the DHS advise the alien of the need for biometrics, and instructs
him how to provide this information; (2) the Immigration Judge identify the deadline upon which
the alien must comply with the biometrics request; and (3) the Immigration Judge inform the alien
of the consequences of failing to comply with the biometrics requirement. See id.
The Immigration Judge stated that on January 17, 2018, he instructed the respondent to submit
the Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal (Form 1-589) to USCIS to initiate
the biometrics process (IJ at 2). The record shows, however, that when the Immigration Judge
asked the respondent if the Form I-589 had been sent to USCIS, the DHS attorney responded that
she had a copy of the application (Tr. at 25). No further inquiry was made into the matter, and no
explanation was given to the respondent as to how he was required to comply with the biometrics
requirements.

While the Immigration Judge furnished a copy of general instructions regarding biometrics
and filing deadlines, that document alone docs not ſully comply with the notice requirements of
Matter of D-M-C-P- See Ex. 10. Because the respondent did not receive proper notice of the
biometrics requirements, we reverse the Immigration Judge's conclusion that the respondent
abandoned his applications for relief, and remand the record for the Immigration Judge to apply
Matter of D-M-C-P..!
Contrary to the respondent's contention on appeal, upon our review of the audio recording of
the April 19, 2018, hearing, we do not view the Immigration Judge's tone as inappropriate
(Respondent's Br. at 4.5). The Immigration Judge stated his recollection of whai had occurred
during the January 17, 2018, hearing. Although his recollection was erroneous, he conducted the
hearing professionally, repeatedly attempted to explain why he deemed the respondent's
applications for relief abandoned, and explained how the respondent could appeal the decision to
the Board. Under these circumstances, the Immigration Judge conducted the hearing fairly.
Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is sustained.
FURTHER ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings
consistent with this order and for the entry of a new decision.

FOR THE BOARD

We acknowledge that the respondent, through counsel, filed evidence demonstrating he
completed biometric processing on May 29, 2018; however, their validity is set to expire soon,
and may require renewal on remand (Respondent's Br., Exh. A).
