IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Gordon Yang, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Heith M. Kaneshige
Acting Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Section 237(a)(1)(H) waiver
The respondent, a native and citizen of Tunisia, appeals the Immigration Judge's
March 12, 2012, decision denying the respondent's application for a waiver of removability
under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H), in
the exercise of discretion.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility,
made by the Immigration Judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo all other
issues, including whether the parties have met the relevant burden of proof, and issues of
discretion. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). Since the respondent's application was filed after
May 11, 2005, it is governed by the provisions of the REAL ID Act.
The Immigration Judge set out the procedural history noting that the respondent's application
for naturalization was denied by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) because he was
not lawfully admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. The DHS found that the
respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident
because he did not comply with the requirement of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under section
212(e) of the Act. The DHS noted that the respondent did not meet the 2-year foreign residency
requirement and he did not obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residency requirement under
section 212(e) of the Act. In November of 2009, the DHS filed a Notice to Appear (NTA) with
the Immigration Court, charging the respondent with removability under section 237(a)(1)(A) of
the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A), as being inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status
under section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), as an immigrant with
no valid immigrant visa or entry document (Exh. 1). In June of 2011, the respondent's request
for a section 212(e) waiver was denied. In August of 2011, the respondent filed a request for a
waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act.
Initially we note that we agree with the Immigration Judge that the DHS has demonstrated by
clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is removable as charged. The respondent
applied for a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act asserting it would waive his
Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013)
A047 654 200
misrepresentation on his Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration and that it
would waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the Act.
In her decision, the Immigration Judge noted that under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act, an
alien must establish that he is the spouse, parents, son, or daughter of a citizen of the United
States or of an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and must
also demonstrate that he is "otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission. The Immigration
Judge concluded that the respondent was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission
because he had not met either the 2-year foreign residency requirement or received a waiver
under section 212(e) of the Act.
We
agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent is not eligible for a waiver under
section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he was not “otherwise admissible” at the time of his
admission. Section 212(e) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(e). The respondent concedes that, having
been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
§ 1101(a)(15)(J), he was subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. He argues, however,
that a waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act waives the 2-year foreign residence
requirement under section 212(e) of the Act. We reject the respondent’s argument for several
reasons. First, section 212(e) of the Act is clear. It requires a 2-year home residence following
completion of schooling in the United States, and it provides for a waiver of that requirement.
It applies to all aliens who came to the United States pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Act
in order to receive graduate medical education or training. We note that section 212(e) of the
Act is unambiguous, and if Congress wanted to allow exemptions from the 2-year foreign
residency requirement it could have done so explicitly. For these reasons, the respondent is
ineligible for waiver under section 237(a)(1)(H) of the Act because he did not satisfy the 2-year
foreign residency requirement and was therefore not "otherwise admissible” at the time of his
admission. Accordingly, the respondent's appeal will be dismissed.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
ORDER: The respondent's appeal is dismissed.
FURTHER ORDER: Pursuant to the Immigration Judge's order and conditioned upon
compliance with conditions set forth by the Immigration Judge and the statute, the respondent is
permitted to voluntarily depart the United States, without expense to the Government, within
60 days from the date of this order or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the
DHS. See section 240B(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(b); see also 8 C.F.R. $$ 1240.26(c), (f).
In the event the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States, the respondent shall be
removed as provided in the Immigration Judge's order.
NOTICE: If the respondent fails to voluntarily depart the United States within the time
period specified, or any extensions granted by the DHS, the respondent shall be subject to a civil
penalty as provided by the regulations and the statute and shall be ineligible for a period of
10 years for any further relief under section 240B and sections 240A, 245, 248, and 249 of the
Act. See section 240B(d) of the Act.
WARNING: If the respondent files a motion to reopen or reconsider prior to the expiration
of the voluntary departure period set forth above, the grant of voluntary departure is
automatically terminated; the period allowed for voluntary departure is not stayed, tolled,
2
Cite as: Ali Fares, A047 654 200 (BIA Apr. 30, 2013)
A047 654 200
or extended. If the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated upon the filing of
a motion, the penalties for failure to depart under section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply.
See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(e)(1).
WARNING: If, prior to departing the United States, the respondent files any judicial
challenge to this administratively final order, such as a petition for review pursuant to section
242 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1252, the grant of voluntary departure is automatically terminated, and
the alternate order of removal shall immediately take effect. However, if the respondent files a
petition for review and then departs the United States within 30 days of such filing, the
respondent will not be deemed to have departed under an order of removal if the alien provides
to the DHS such evidence of his or her departure that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement
Field Office Director of the DHS may require and provides evidence DHS deems sufficient that
he or she has remained outside of the United States. The penalties for failure to depart under
section 240B(d) of the Act shall not apply to an alien who files a petition for review,
notwithstanding any period of time that he or she remains in the United States while the petition
for review is pending. See 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(i).

WRITTEN DECISION AND ORDER OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
1.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Ali Fares (“Respondent”) is a married, male, native and citizen of Tunisia. See Exhibits
1, 2. On March 30, 1993, Respondent was admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant J-1
student, to pursue his Ph.D. in Agronomy, which was partially funded by the A.I.D. Technology
Transfer Project, program number G-2-0263. Id. In December 1999, Respondent departed the
United States and went to Australia where he remained for approximately one year. Id. On
December 31, 2000, Respondent was admitted to the United States at New York City, New York,
as a DV2 immigrant. Id.
On August 31, 2006, Respondent filed the form N-400, Application for Naturalization
with the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). See Exhibit 2. On September 10, 2009,
Respondent's application was denied under INA § 316.2, because he was not lawfully admitted
as a permanent resident of the United States. Id. Specifically, the DHS found that Respondent
was not eligible to be admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident because he
failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1 nonimmigrant status under INA 212(e). Id.
Under INA § 212(e), no person admitted under INA § 101(a)(15)(J) whose participation in the
program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by the government of the
country of his nationality or his last residence shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or
for permanent residence until it is established that such person has resided and been physically
present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years
following departure from the United States. The DHS explained that prior to Respondent's
immigrating to the United States on December 31, 2000, Respondent was not physically present
in Tunisia and he failed to obtain a waiver to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under
Section 212(e), and therefore, he did not lawfully enter the United States as a permanent resident,
rendering him ineligible for naturalization. See Exhibit 2.
On November 5, 2009, the DHS served Respondent with the form 1-862, Notice to
Appear (“NTA”), charging him as removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A), in that at the time of
entry or of adjustment of status, Respondent was within one or more of the classes of aliens
inadmissible by the law existing at such time, to wit: alien immigrants who are not in possession
of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other
valid entry document required by the Act, or who are not in possession of a valid unexpired
passport, or other suitable travel document, or identity and nationality document if such
document is required by regulations issued by the Attorney General pursuant to Section
212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). Exhibit 1. On January 11, 2010, the charging document was filed with the
Honolulu Immigration Court, thereby vesting this Court with jurisdiction over these proceedings.
See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a).
At a master calendar hearing on March 1, 2010, the DHS submitted evidence in support
of its argument that Respondent is removable. See Exhibit 2. Respondent, with the assistance of
counsel, admitted allegations one through five contained in the NTA and conceded removability.
Respondent indicated that this is not an asylum, withholding of removal or Convention Against
Torture case and designated Tunisia as the country of removal. Respondent asserted that he was
seeking a 212(e) waiver from the Department of State.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
On April 23, 2010, Respondent filed a motion to continue, which was granted. See
Exhibit 3. On July 30, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was granted.
See Exhibit 4. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed another motion to continue, which was
granted. See Exhibit 5. On February 10, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for administrative
closure, which was denied, because the DHS did not agree. See Exhibit 6. At a master calendar
hearing on June 27, 2011, Respondent informed the Court that his request for a Section 212(e)
waiver was denied.
On August 26, 2011, Respondent filed a request for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H),
along with evidence in support of his request. See Exhibit 7. On November 28, 2011,
Respondent filed a motion to advance his individual hearing. See Exhibit 8. On January 3, 2012,
Respondent filed supplementary evidence. See Exhibit 9. On January 12, 2012, the DHS filed
evidence in support of its position that Respondent is removable and not eligible for a
237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 10.
On January 13, 2012, Respondent appeared for an individual hearing. At the hearing, he
A047 654 200
2
March 12, 2012
requested additional time to seek prosecutorial discretion or administrative closure with the DHS,
which was granted. Respondent's individual hearing was rescheduled to February 8, 2012. On
January 30, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in support of his argument that he is eligible
for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver. See Exhibit 11.
On February 8, 2012, Respondent again appeared for an individual hearing and informed
the Court that he and the DHS did not have a joint motion to file. The DHS agreed to
administrative closure but Respondent declined, stating that he wanted a resolution to his
immigration status. Respondent explained that he had contacted Senator Inouye's office but they
were unable to assist in his 212(e) waiver request with the Department of State. Respondent
requested additional time to prepare, which was granted. Respondent's individual hearing was
rescheduled to June 1, 2012. On February 29, 2012, Respondent filed a motion to advance his
individual hearing. See Exhibit 12. On March 12, 2012, Respondent appeared for his individual
hearing. Respondent asserted that he is eligible for relief under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) alone and
made closing arguments. Respondent requested voluntary departure in the alternative.
II.
ANALYSIS
The DHS demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent is removable
as charged in the NTA. The DHS alleged that Respondent was not eligible to be admitted to the
United States as a lawful permanent resident in December 2000 because he made a material
misrepresentation on his visa application and failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1
nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e). In support of its argument, the DHS submitted a copy
of Respondent's immigrant visa application. See Exhibit 2. The application asked if Respondent
was “an alien who is a former exchange visitor who has not fulfilled the 2-year foreign residence
requirement (212(e)]” and he checked the box marked, "No." Id.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
Respondent admitted that he failed to comply with the requirements of his J-1
nonimmigrant status under INA § 212(e), and claimed that he did not know about the intricacies
of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Respondent admitted that he made a
misrepresentation on his visa application, and he conceded that he is removable as charged under
INA § 237(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his entry, he was inadmissible as an alien immigrant
who was not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa.
A.
212(e) Waiver
Respondent sought a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement of Section
212(e) with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. See Exhibit10.
Under 212(e),
No person admitted under section 101(a)(15)(I), (i) whose participation in the
program for which he came to the United States was financed in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, by an agency of the Government of the United States or by
A047 654 200
3
March 12, 2012
the government of the country of his nationality or his last residence, (ii) who at the
time of admission or acquisition of the status under 101(a)(J) was a national or
resident of a country which the Director of the former United States Information
Agency (now the Secretary of USDOS), pursuant to the regulations prescribed by
him, had designated as clearly requiring the skills in which the alien was engaged,
or (iii) or who came to the United States in order to receive graduate medical
education or training shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa, or for
permanent residence, or for a nonimmigrant visa under section 101(a)(15)(H) or
section 101(a)(15)(L) until it is established that such person has resided and been
physically present in the country of his nationality or his last residence for an
aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States:
Provided, That upon the favorable recommendation of the Director, pursuant to the
request of an interested United States Government agency (or, in the case of an
alien described in clause (iii), pursuant to the request of a State Department of
Public Health, or its equivalent), ... the Attorney General may waive the
requirement of such two-year foreign residence abroad in the case of any alien
whose admission to the United States is found by the Attorney General to be in the
public interest except that in the case of a waiver required by a State Department of
Public Health, or its equivalent, or in the case of a waiver requested by an
interested United States Government Agency on behalf of the alien described in
clause (iii), the waiver shall be subject to the requirements of section 214(1): and
provided further, That, except in the case of an alien described in clause (iii), the
Attorney General may, upon favorable recommendation of the Director, waive
such two-year foreign residence requirement in any case in which the foreign
country of the alien's nationality or last residence has furnished the Director a
statement in writing that it has no objection to such waiver in the case of such
alien.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
It is undisputed that Respondent was admitted to the United States pursuant to INA S
101(a)(15)(J)(i) and that he was ineligible to apply for admission to the United States as a
permanent resident in 2000 because he had not resided and been physically present in Tunisia for
an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States. Therefore,
Respondent is removable under INA § 237(a)(1)(A). Respondent applied for a waiver under INA
§ 212(e); however, it was denied by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland
Security. This Court cannot grant a waiver under INA § 212(e) in this case as a favorable
recommendation of the Secretary of State is a necessary prerequisite to approval of an application
for a waiver of the two-year foreign residence requirement. See Matter of Tayabji, 19 I&N Dec.
264 (BIA 1985).
B.
237(a)(1)(H) Waiver
Respondent applied for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H), asserting that it would waive
his misrepresentation for answering “No” to question J on the form 230, Application for
A047 654 200
4
March 12, 2012
Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration. See Exhibits 2, 10. Respondent also asserts that the
237(a)(1)(H) waiver waives the 2-year foreign residence requirement under INA § 212(e).
The provisions of section 237(a)(1) of the Act relating to the removal of an alien on the
ground that he was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien described in INA §
212(a)(6)(C)(i) for fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact at the time of admission,
whether willful or innocent, may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be waived for any
alien who meets the requirements under section 237(a)(1)(H)(i) or (ii) of the Act. The Board of
Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) has also found that INA § 237(a)(1)(H) authorizes a waiver for
charges of inadmissibility under INA § 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(1), for a lack of a valid visa or entry
document. See Matter of Fu, 23 I&N Dec. 985, 988 (BIA 2006). The BIA has recognized that
Congress's intent in enacting INA § 237(a)(1)(H) was to foster, in appropriate cases, the unity of
families composed, in part, of U.S. citizens or LPRs. See Matter of Tijam, 22 I&N Dec. 408,
416-17 (B1A 1998).
An alien meets the requirements of INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i) if he is the spouse, parent, son,
or daughter of a citizen of the U.S. or of an alien lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent
residence. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(i)(1). However, the alien must also have been in possession of an
immigrant visa or equivalent document and have been otherwise admissible at the time of such
admission, except for the grounds of inadmissibility specified under INA §§ 212(a)(5)(A) (not in
possession of a labor certification) and (7)(A) (not in possession of a valid immigrant visa or
other required documents or whose visa has was not issued in compliance with section 203 of the
Act), which were a direct result of that fraud or misrepresentation. INA § 237(a)(1)(H)(1)(II).
Here, Respondent is the spouse of a U.S. citizen and the father of four U.S. citizen children.
However, although a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H) could waive the misrepresentation on his
visa application, Respondent was not "otherwise admissible” at the time of his admission as a
permanent resident in 2000, because he had not resided and been physically present in the
country of his nationality or his last residence for an aggregate of at least two years following
departure from the United States. Moreover, Respondent has not received a waiver under INA $
212(e), the exclusive means to waive the 2-year foreign residence requirement. Matter of
Musharraf, 17 I&N Dec. 462 (BIA 1980).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
Respondent argues that he is eligible for relief and not subjected to the requirements
under INA § 212(e), because INA § 237(a)(1)(H) can be used in lieu of such a waiver, relying on
Chuey v. INS, 439 F.2d 244, 249 (9th Cir. 1970). However, this case was explicitly overturned
by the United States Supreme Court in Reid v. INS, 420 U.S. 619, 620 (1975) (holding that a
waiver under former INA § 241(1) does not extend to any grounds of inadmissibility specified in
INA § 212(a) other than former subsection (19)). The Court also notes that the Ninth Circuit has
previously determined that the Government is not estopped from enforcing the two-year foreign
residence requirement under INA § 212(e), even when it engages in negligent misconduct. See
Mukherjee v. INS, 793 F.2d 1006 (9th Cir. 1986) (denying the alien's equitable estoppel claim
where the consular officer told the alien that he would not be subjected to the 2-year foreign
residence requirement but the INS found him ineligible to adjust status under INA § 212(e)).
A047 654 200

March 12, 2012
While Respondent certainly merits relief as a matter of discretion, Respondent is
statutorily ineligible to apply for a 237(a)(1)(H) waiver because he was not "otherwise
admissible” at the time of his admission in 2000. See Matter of Tijam, 22 I&N Dec. at 412-16.
ACCORDINGLY, the following order shall be entered:
ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA 212(e) is
DENIED.
IT IS ORDERED that Respondent's application for a waiver under INA § 237(a)(1)(H)
is DENIED.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent be GRANTED voluntary departure at the
conclusion of proceedings under INA § 240B(b), in lieu of removal, without expense to
the Government, on or before May 11, 2012, or any extensions as may be granted by the
Field Office Director, Department of Homeland Security, and under any other conditions
the Field Office Director may direct.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent post a voluntary departure bond in the
amount of $500 with the Department of Homeland Security within 5 business days.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center | www.irac.net
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if any of the above ordered conditions are not met as
required, or if Respondent fails to depart as required, the above grant of post-conclusion
voluntary departure shall be withdrawn without further notice or proceedings and the
following order, entered pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(d), shall become immediately
effective: Respondent shall be removed to Tunisia on the charge contained in the Notice
to Appear.
Respondent is HEREBY ADVISED that if he fails to voluntarily depart the United States
within the time specified, or within any extensions that may be granted by the Department
of Homeland Security, Respondent will be subject to the following penalties:
1. Respondent will be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000
and not more than $5,000. INA § 240B(d). The Court has set the presumptive
civil monetary penalty amount of $3,000. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.26(j).
2. Respondent will be ineligible, for a period of 10 years, to receive cancellation
of removal, adjustment of status, registry, voluntary departure, or a change in
nonimmigrant status. INA § 240B(d).
Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he appeals this decision Respondent must
A047 654 200
6
March 12, 2012
provide to the Board of Immigration Appeals, within 30 days of filing an appeal,
sufficient proof of having posted the voluntary departure bond. The Board will not
reinstate the voluntary departure period in its final order if Respondent does not submit
timely proof to the Board that the voluntary departure bond has been posted. 8 C.F.R. §
1240.26(c)(3)(ii).
Respondent is FURTHER ADVISED that if he or she does not appeal this decision and
instead files a motion to reopen or reconsider during the voluntary departure period, the
period allowed for voluntary departure will not be stayed, tolled, or extended, the grant of
voluntary departure will be terminated automatically, the alternate order of removal will
take effect immediately, and the above penalties for failure to depart voluntarily under
section 240B(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d), will not apply. 8 C.F.R. $$
