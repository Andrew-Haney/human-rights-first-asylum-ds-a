In re: CLEBSON SOUSA CARNEIRO a.k.a. Clebson Carneiro-De Sousa
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Carolyn Mikula McIntosh, Esquire
APPLICATION: Reopening
The respondent, a native and citizen of Brazil, appeals from an Immigration Judge's decision
dated July 13, 2015, denying the respondent's March 5, 2015, motion to reopen his January 21,
2015, removal proceedings, which had been conducted in absentia under section 240(b)(5)(A) of
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(A). The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) has not filed a response to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
We have considered the totality of the circumstances presented in this case and find that
reopening and rescission of the in absentia removal order is warranted. We have specifically
considered the respondent's affidavit in which the respondent states that, after he was released on
his own recognizance by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he reported to ICE
on three separate occasions, and once again following the entry of the in absentia order; that the
respondent attempted to inform ICE in person and by telephone of his correct address; that the
respondent was diligent in seeking reopening; and that the respondent was not given the oral
warnings for failing to appear at his hearing in his native language of Portuguese. Matter of
M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 665 (BIA 2008). Accordingly, the appeal will be sustained, the in absentia
order will be rescinded, the proceedings will be reopened, and the record will be remanded to
allow the respondent another opportunity to appear for his hearing.

ORDER: The appeal is sustained, the in absentia order is vacated, proceedings are reopened,
and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings.

ORDER OF THE IMMIGRATION COURT
The Respondent's motion for a custody redetermination is denied for lack of jurisdiction.
On January 21, 2015, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) entered an in absentia order
of removal against the Respondent. On July 13, 2015, the Court denied the Respondent's motion
to reopen, at which time his removal order became final. See 8 C.F.R. § 1241.1(e); see also 8
C.F.R. § 241.4(b)(1) ("An alien who has filed a motion to reopen immigration proceedings for
consideration of relief from removal ... shall remain subject to the provisions of this section
unless the motion to reopen is granted.”).
On March 5, 2015, the Respondent filed with the Court a motion to request a bond
hearing. Essentially, the Respondent seeks a modification of the conditions of his release
imposed by the Department of Homeland Security-namely, the use of a GPS monitoring
device. However, this Court has no authority to redetermine the conditions of an alien's release
once an order of removal becomes final.' See 8 C.F.R. § 1236.1(d)(1). Consequently, the
Respondent's motion to request a bond hearing is denied.
'If the DHS determines that the Respondent is a class member such that this rule does not apply, the DHS shall
inform this court and Respondent's counsel.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent's motion for custody redetermination be

ON RESPONDENT’S MOTION TO REOPEN
I.
Procedural History
On September 5, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apprehended the
Respondent, Clebson Sousa Carneiro, and his family at the Santa Rite area at or near Laredo,
Texas. Exh. 2, Form I-213 (Jan. 21, 2015). The Respondent and his family were arrested and
transported to the Laredo South Border Patrol Station in Laredo, Texas, for processing. Id.
Shortly thereafter, DHS initiated removal proceedings against the Respondent through personal
service of a Notice to Appear (NTA) alleging that the Respondent is not a citizen or national of
the United States and is a native and citizen of Brazil who arrived in the United States at or near
Laredo, Texas, on or about September 4, 2013, without being admitted or paroled after
inspection by an immigration officer. Exh. 1, NTA (Jan. 21, 2015). Based on these allegations,
DHS charged the Respondent as removable pursuant to section 212(a)(O)(A)(i) of the Act. Id.
The Respondent was then released on his own recognizance. See Exh. 2; see also Resp’t Mot. to
Reopen at Tab A (Mar. 5, 2015).
The NTA informed the Respondent that he was ordered to appear before an immigration
judge for a hearing regarding his removal proceedings on a date and at a time to be determined.
1
Exh. 1. The Respondent was given oral notice in the Spanish language of the contents of the
NTA as well as the consequences of failing to appear as ordered. Id. In addition, the
Respondent was reminded of his duty to keep the Immigration Court informed of his current
address by using Form EOIR-33 whenever his address or telephone number changed during the
course of his removal proceedings. Id. Upon release from DHS custody, the Respondent
reported his address as 12 Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Form I-830 (Aug. 22,
2014); see also Exh. 1.
On September 22, 2014, the Boston Immigration Court (Court) sent a Notice of Hearing,
along with Form EOIR-33, by mail to the Respondent at his reported address—12 Cutter Street,
Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. Exh. 1A, Notice of Hearing (Sept. 22, 2014). Nothing in the
record suggests that the notice was returned as undeliverable. On January 21, 2015, the
Respondent did not appear for his scheduled hearing, and the Court proceeded in absentia.
Removal Order of the IJ (Jan. 21, 2015). The issue of removability having been established, the
Court ordered the Respondent removed to Brazil. Id.
II.
Motion to Reopen
On March 5, 2015, the Respondent, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen alleging
that he never received notice of his January 21, 2015 hearing. Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at 2.
According to the Respondent, he “had advised ICE both in person and telephonically from the
beginning that his address was in Everett, Massachusetts.” Id. at 3. Specifically, the Respondent
asserts that he "did not provide the address to which the final notice of hearing was mailed” and
further, that he “advised ICE that this address was incorrect and gave them (his) address at: 3
Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts.” Id. at 5, 174 6. Accordingly, because
the NTA "did not contain the date and time of his hearing,” the Respondent argues that the notice
requirements of INA § 239(a)(G)(i) were never fulfilled “because he never received written
notice of the time and date of his hearing at an address he provided.” Id. at 5. Alternatively, the
Respondent requests sua sponte reopening, contending that his circumstances rise to the level of
exceptional circumstances because he “has complied with ICE's entire request for reporting” and
"made known to ICE his appropriate address.” Id. at 7.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The Respondent seeks to reopen his proceedings so that he may seek relief in the form of
asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Id. at 2.
In support of his motion, the Respondent submitted, inter alia, two sworn affidavits' and a Form
1-589. Id. at Tabs C-D.
III.
Standards of Law
In general, motions to reopen are “disfavored as contrary to the compelling public
interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings."» Raza v. Gonzalez, 484 F.3d
125, 127 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 2005)).
Accordingly, there are procedural and substantive bars to reopening removal proceedings. See
The Respondent's first affidavit addresses his failure to appear at his January 21, 2015 hearing. See id. at Tab C.
The Respondent's second affidavit addresses his 1-589 application. See id. at Tab D, 32-34.
2
Smith v. Holder, 627 F.3d 427, 433 (1st Cir. 2010); see also 8 C.F.R. SS 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(3),
(4) (2014).
The Court may upon its own motion at any time, or upon motion by DHS or the
Respondent, reopen or reconsider any case in which it has made a decision, unless jurisdiction is
vested with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA or Board). 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).
Subject to limited exceptions, a party may only file one motion to reopen, which must generally
be filed within ninety days of the entry of a final order of removal. Id. With respect to orders of
removal entered in absentia, such orders may be rescinded only upon (1) a motion to reopen
filed within 180 days after the date of the order of removal only if the alien demonstrates that the
failure to appear resulted from exceptional circumstances (as defined in section 240(e)(1) of the
Act) or (2) a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not
receive notice of the hearing. INA § 240(b)(5)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). Notice shall be
served either in person or, where personal service is impractical, by regular mail to the
Respondent's last known address. INA § 239(a)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.13.
The motion to reopen shall state the new facts that the party will prove at a hearing to be
held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits and other evidentiary material.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3). Further, a motion to reopen for the purpose of applying for a form of
relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting
documents. Id.; Palma-Mazariegos v. Keisler, 504 F.3d 144, 147 (1st Cir. 2007). To reopen his
case, the Respondent must establish a prima facie case of eligibility for the underlying relief
sought. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94 (1988). Although the
Court has broad discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen, an applicant must meet the “heavy
burden” of showing that the new evidence offered would likely change the outcome of the case if
the proceedings were reopened. Matter of Coelho, 20 I&N Dec. 464, 473 (BIA 1992).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
While the Court may reopen a case under its sua sponte power, as a general rule such
authority is used sparingly; it is not meant to be a "general remedy for any hardships created by
enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations, but rather as an
extraordinary remedy reserved for truly exceptional situations.” Matter of G-D-, 22 I&N Dec.
1132, 1133 (BIA 1999); see also Matter of Jean, 23 I&N Dec. 373, 380 n.9 (A.G. 2002).
IV.
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
As a preliminary matter, the Court finds that the Respondent's motion to reopen is timely
as it has been filed within ninety days of the entry of the final order of removal. See 8 C.F.R. $
1003.23(b)(1); Removal Order of the IJ; Resp’t Mot. to Reopen. Nevertheless, the Court finds
that the Respondent has not demonstrated that he did not receive sufficient notice of the January
21, 2015 hearing. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
To begin with, notwithstanding the Respondent's contention that he never received notice
of his hearing, the Court finds that the notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent, by regular
mail and according to normal office procedures, at the only address he provided to the Court—12
Cutter Street, Somerville, Massachusetts 02145. See Exhs. 1-1A; Form I-830. Accordingly,
delivery of the notice of hearing to the Respondent is presumed. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N
3
Dec. 665, 673 (BIA 2008) (“We find it is proper to apply some presumption of receipt to a
Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing sent by regular mail when the notice is properly addressed
and mailed according to normal office procedures."). Moreover, this was the same address listed
on the NTA, which was personally served upon the Respondent. See Exh. 1. Thus, in order for
the Respondent to prevail on his motion to reopen, he must present sufficient evidence to
overcome this presumption of delivery. See Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 673 (“[W]hen a
respondent seeks to reopen proceedings based on a claim of lack of receipt of notice, the
question to be determined is whether the respondent has presented sufficient evidence to
overcome the weaker presumption of delivery attached to notices delivered by regular mail.").
In determining whether sufficient evidence has been presented to rebut the presumption
of delivery that is associated with the use of regular mail, the Court may consider a variety of
factors that can support a motion to reopen. See id. at 674 (identifying several of the relevant
factors and emphasizing that “[e]ach case must be evaluated based on its own particular
circumstances and evidence."). With respect to the Respondent’s motion to reopen, there is little
to no evidence in the record that rebuts the presumption of delivery. First, the Respondent has
not initiated the proceedings himself, such as by affirmatively applying for a particular form of
relief, which would serve to bolster the Respondent's incentive to appear. Cf. id. (finding that
the respondent's affirmative application for asylum established his incentive to appear and
negated any motive to miss subsequent hearings thereby rebutting the presumption of delivery).
Moreover, it does not appear that the Respondent’s notice of hearing was returned to the Court as
undeliverable. Rather, the only evidence offered by the Respondent in support of his motion to
reopen are his own assertions that he did not receive notice of the hearing, that the address to
which the notice of hearing was sent was not the address he provided, and that the address he
reported to DHS is 3 Elmwood Street, Apartment # 2, Everett, Massachusetts. See Resp’t Mot.
to Reopen at 5, 17 16. However, while the First Circuit has declined to presume that every
notice sent by regular mail has been received by the recipient absent an extraordinary evidentiary
showing, it has expressed that “a bare, uncorroborated, self-serving denial of receipt, even if
sworn, is weak evidence.” Kozak v. Gonzales, 502 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 2007).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Furthermore, while the Respondent does not expressly assert that ICE made an error in
recording his address when he was personally served with the NTA, such an argument-even if
inferred from the Respondent’s motion to reopen—would not be sufficient to rebut the
presumption of delivery. First, the blatant discrepancy between the two addresses suggests that
any potential error in the recording of the address was not due to a mere omission or oversight on
the part of DHS. In other words, there is no evidence suggesting that DHS did not accurately
record the Respondent's address as given in the ordinary course. Second, the failure to cure any
potential defect in the Respondent's reported address cannot be attributed to DHS or the Court in
the first place, as that responsibility rests entirely with the Respondent. See 8 C.F.R. §
1003.15(d)(1); see also Matter of Grijalva, 21 I&N Dec. 27, 37 (BIA 1995) (“[The] presumption
of effective service may be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper
delivery [if] the respondent () present[s] substantial and probative evidence
demonstrating that there was improper delivery or that nondelivery was not due to the
respondent's failure to provide an address where he could receive mail.") (emphasis added).
Moreover, although the Respondent makes the bare assertion that he advised DHS that his
address was incorrect and then provided them with the correct address, any effort to cure a
4
potential defect in the Respondent's reported address must be directed toward the Immigration
Court through the use of Form EOIR-33. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(1) (providing that if an
alien's address as listed on the NTA is incorrect, “the alien must provide to the Immigration
Court ... an address ... at which the alien can be contacted) (emphasis added); see also Exh. 1
(“You must notify the Immigration Court immediately by using Form EOIR-33 whenever you
change your address ... during the course of this proceeding.”) (emphasis added). Finally, and
especially determinative, the address to which the notice of hearing was sent to is the same
address listed on the NTA, which was signed by the Respondent. See Exhs, 1-1A.
Ultimately, the Respondent cannot now claim a lack of notice due to what amounts to his
own negligence. The Respondent was personally served with a NTA on September 5, 2013.
Exh. 1. The Respondent was thereby advised, both in writing and orally, that removal
proceedings had been initiated against him and that he should soon expect a notice informing
him of his hearing before the Court. In addition, the Respondent was also advised of his duty to
keep the Court informed of any changes in his address. See id. Given the gravity of these
advisements, this duty naturally encompassed any errors in the initial recording of the
Respondent's address to which the Respondent should have reasonably been aware of. See
Matter of M-R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. at 675 (“[A] respondent cannot evade delivery of a properly sent
Notice of Hearing by relocating without providing the required change of address and then
request reopening of in absentia proceedings on the basis of a claim that he did not receive
notice.”). Despite this, the Respondent offers no evidence demonstrating that he ever submitted
or attempted to submit a Form EOIR-33 to the Court in order to indicate his correct address.
Accordingly, the Court finds that the Respondent has failed to show the requisite lack of notice
with respect to his January 21, 2015 hearing to warrant the reopening of his proceedings on that
basis. See INA § 240(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
Finally, in addition to the circumstances described above, the Respondent has failed to
demonstrate prima facie eligibility for the relief he seeks, and thus, the Court declines to exercise
its limited discretion to reopen sua sponte. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3); see also Matter of J-J-,
21 I&N Dec. 976 (BIA 1997) (holding the BIA and Immigration Judge's power to reopen or
reconsider cases sua sponte is limited to exceptional circumstances and is not meant to cure
filing defects or circumvent regulations, where enforcing them might result in hardship).
Specifically, although the Respondent indicated in his Form 1-589 that he is seeking asylum or
withholding of removal on the basis of membership in a particular social group, he did not
expressly articulate any particular social group to which he belongs or with which he identifies.?
See Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D; see also Matter of A-T-, 24 I&N Dec. 617, 623 n.7 (BIA
2008) (discussing the importance of establishing the "on account of” element in asylum and
withholding claims and explaining that it is the applicant's burden to initially identify the
particular social group or groups in which membership is claimed); Rodriguez-Ramirez v.
Ashcroft, 398 F. 3d 120, 125 (1st Cir. 2005) (“[A] person who claims a fear of persecution on
account of social group membership must at a bare minimum identify with particularity the
social group with which he claims to be associated."). At most, the Respondent indicated in his
second affidavit that he and his family's home in the city of Goiania were targeted by the local
2
Although the Respondent also indicated that he is seeking asylum or withholding of removal on the basis of race,
nationality, political opinion, and the Convention Against Torture, he has not provided any evidence nor made any
assertions as to his eligibility on either of those grounds. See Resp't Mot. to Reopen at Tab D.
S
police because these individuals targeted people who had returned from the United States after
years away .... [because) these bandits thought that we had returned with a lot of money from
the United States.” Resp’t Mot. to Reopen at Tab D, 34 11 13-20. However, even if the Court
infers from the Respondent's second affidavit that he identifies his social group as individuals
having spent time in the United States prior to returning to their home country, such a group is
not a viable particular social group for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal. See
Rojas-Perez v. Holder, 699 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 2012) (“Both this court and the BIA have
rejected calls to recognize individuals who might be perceived as being wealthy or as having
money' and are returning to their country of origin after living in the Unites States as legally
cognizable social groups.").
Accordingly, the following order shall be entered:
ORDER
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent’s Motion to Reopen be DENIED.
