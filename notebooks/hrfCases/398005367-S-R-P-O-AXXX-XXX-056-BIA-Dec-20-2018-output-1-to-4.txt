IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Rachel Wilson, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS:
Gilda M. Terrazas
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture

The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge's decision
dated August 2, 2017, denying her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection
under the Convention Against Torture. Sections 208(b)(1)(A) and 241(b)(3)(A) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(b)(1)(A) and 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.13(b)(1), 1208.16(a), 1208.18. The Department of Homeland Security has submitted a
brief in opposition to the appeal. The record will be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

We review the findings of fact made by the Immigration Judge, including the determination of
credibility, for clear error. 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review all other issues, including
questions of judgment, discretion, and law, de novo. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

The respondent's removability is undisputed. Therefore, the issue on appeal is whether the
Immigration Judge properly denied her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture. In support of those applications, the respondent
credibly testified that on August 18, 2016, she was abducted and blindfolded in Mexico by
unknown individuals, and then held for 2 or 3 days in an unknown location where she was
repeatedly raped (IJ at 2-3, 9; Tr. at 124, 127-34). The respondent further testified that immediately
following this incident, she went to a hospital where she obtained medical treatment her
injuries, and also went to the police, but a report was not filed because the respondent believes that
the authorities were not taking her seriously (IJ at 3; Tr. at 139-43).
i
!
Based on the foregoing facts, the respondent argues that she suffered past persecution in
Mexico, and also has a well-founded fear of future persecution there, on account of her
membership in either of two “particular social groups,” which she defines as “Mexican women”
and “Mexican women who are victims or potential victims of gender-motivated violence.”
Although the Immigration Judge agreed with the respondent that the ham she experienced in
Mexico was severe enough to rise to the level of past “persecution” (IJ at 13), he determined that
the respondent was not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal because neither of her
claimed “particular social groups” was cognizable (IJ at 11-13). The respondent challenges that
determination on appeal (Respondent's Br. at 4-7).

As previously stated, the respondent asserts that she belongs to two particular social groups,
comprised of “Mexican women” and “Mexican women who are victims or potential victims of
gender-motivated violence.” To establish that these groups are cognizable under the asylum and
withholding of removal statutes, the respondent must prove that the groups are: “(1) composed of
members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and
(3) socially distinct within [Mexican] society...." Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 319
(A.G. 2018) (quoting Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 237 (BIA 2014)); see also
Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208, 212-18 (BIA 2014), aff d in pertinent part and vacated and
remanded in part on other grounds sub nom. Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir. 2016), cert.
denied sub nom. Reyes v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 736 (2018).
The Immigration Judge found that although “Mexican women” satisfies the foregoing
immutability and social distinction requirements, it lacks “particularity” because it defines a
“demographic unit” of great diversity rather than a discrete group, and is “exceedingly broad
because it would conceivably include a majority of the population of Mexico” (IJ at 12). The
Immigration Judge also found that the group “Mexican women who are victims or potential
victims of gender-motivated violence” is not cognizable because it is circular (IJ at 12-13).
We agree with the Immigration Judge's decision as it relates to “Mexican women who are
victims or potential victims of gender-motivated violence.” To be cognizable, a particular social
group must exist independently of the harm claimed by its members. Matter of A-B-,
27 I&N Dec. at 317, 334-35; Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. at 215; Matter of A-M-E- & J-G-U-,
24 I&N Dec. 69, 74 (BIA 2007). The respondent's alternative group does not satisfy that
requirement because it is defined by reference to the persecution (i.e., "gender-motivated
violence”) its members claim to suffer (or fear).

Following the Immigration Judge's decision and during the pendency of this appeal, the
Attomey General issued a precedential decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316
(A.G. 2018), clarifying the criteria required to establish an asylum claim based on membership in
a particular social group. In light of this intervening precedent decision, we will remand the record
to allow the Immigration Judge to supplement his decision and reconsider the respondent's asylum
and withholding of removal claims insofar as they are based on her claimed membership in a
particular social group comprised of “Mexican women.” In evaluating the "particularity" of the
claimed group, the Immigration Judge should consider Matter of A-B- as well as pertinent portions
of Henriquez-Rivas v. Holder, 707 F.3d 1081, 1093–94 (9th Cir. 2013), and Perdomo v. Holder,
611 F.3d 662, 669 (9th Cir. 2010). Accord Ticas-Guillen v. Whitaker,
F. App'x ----,
No. 16-72981 (9th Cir. Nov. 30, 2018), available at 2018 WL 6266766. On remand, the
Immigration Judge should also consider whether the respondent has demonstrated a nexus between
her proposed particular social group and the past harm she suffered or future harm she fears and
whether the Mexican goverment was (or will be) unable or unwilling to control her persecutors.
See Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. at 320, 343-44; see also Ochoa v. Gonzales, 406 F.3d 1166, 1170

by a “goverment official or persons the goverment is unable or unwilling to control”). We
express no opinion regarding the ultimate outcome of the respondent's case.'
Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.
