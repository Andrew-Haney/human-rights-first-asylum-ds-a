IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Jared S. Lawrence, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: Jonathan Stowers
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Mexico, appeals from the Immigration Judge's decision
dated June 6, 2017, which denied his application for protection under the Convention Against
Torture, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c), but granted voluntary departure under section 240B of the Act,
8 U.S.C. § 1229c. The parties have provided arguments on appeal. The appeal will be sustained,
and the record will be remanded.

We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under a de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The record shows that during the merits hearing, the respondent testified about an article and
other documents concerning his cousin, who was kidnapped and killed (Tr. at 30-31). When
questioned about why the documents were not submitted into evidence, it was noted that they were
included in the submission for bond proceedings (Tr. at 30, 33). The Immigration Judge declined
the respondent's request to admit the bond submission into evidence, stating that the file is separate
and apart from removal proceedings (Tr. at 34-35).' See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d); see also Matter
of P-C-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 432 (BIA 1991).
We disagree with the Immigration Judge's conclusion that he was foreclosed from substituting
documents in the bond record to the record in the instant removal proceeding. Based on the
testimony from the respondent, the evidence is relevant to both the bond and merits cases, and it
Because the Immigration Judge noted on the record that he had looked at the bond file during
the merits hearing, it is clear that the bond file was available (Tr. at 38).
2 Inasmuch as we do not have access to the evidence in question, we are unable to evaluate the
Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) contention on appeal that, even if the Immigration

would amount to form over substance effectively to lock away the bond file. We acknowledge
that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.19(d) states that consideration by the Immigration Judge of an application
regarding custody or bond shall be separate and apart from any removal proceeding. However,
nothing in the regulation provides that evidence in the bond file cannot be retrieved and offered
separately during the merits case if admissible in both settings. Although the Immigration Judge
cannot entertain the bond record, he can entertain identical evidence in both contexts. Therefore,
we will sustain the appeal and remand for further proceedings. Accordingly, the following order
will be entered.
ORDER: The appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for
further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion and for the entry of a new decision.

In so doing, the Immigration Judge should ensure that each file contains either the originals or
the photocopies of the submission in question.
