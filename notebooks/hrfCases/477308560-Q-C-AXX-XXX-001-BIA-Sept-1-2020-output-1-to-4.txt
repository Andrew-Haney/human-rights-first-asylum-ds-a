In re:
IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Thuy Pham, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of the People's Republic of China, appeals from the
Immigration Judge's March 29, 2018, decision denying his applications for asylum under section
208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, and withholding of removal under
section 241(b)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), as well as a request for protection under Article
3 of the Convention Against Torture, as implemented by 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16-.18. The
Department of Homeland Security has not responded to the appeal. The appeal will be sustained.
The record will be remanded.

We review findings of fact, including credibility findings, for clear error. See 8 C.F.R.
$ 1003.1(d)(3)(i); see also Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. 260 (BIA 2007); Matter of S-H-, 23 I&N
Dec. 462 (BIA 2002). We review questions of law, discretion, or judgment, and all other issues
de novo. See 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).

We reverse the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility determination. “It has been held that
'[a] finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court
on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
committed." Matter of R-S-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 629, 637 (BIA 2003) (quoting United States
v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)) (additional internal quotation marks
removed). We may not overturn a factual finding merely because we would have weighed the
evidence differently or decided the facts differently had we been the factfinder. Id. (citations
omitted). Under our review for clear error, an Immigration Judge's credibility determinations are
due “even greater deference.” Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 341 (A.G. 2018) (citation
omitted).
Under the provisions of the REAL ID Act, an Immigration Judge may base a credibility
determination on any inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood, without regard to whether that
inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of an applicant's claim. See section
208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act; Matter of J-Y-C-, 24 I&N Dec. at 262 (“The credibility standard, as
amended, is intended to allow Immigration Judges to follow a 'commonsense' approach while
‘tak[ing] into consideration the individual circumstances of the specific witness and/or
applicant.””). In assessing credibility, an Immigration Judge must consider the totality of the
circumstances and all relevant factors. See section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act.

The respondent testified that he practiced Catholicism both in China and the United States.
The Immigration Judge rejected this testimony, finding that the respondent had an evasive and
deceptive demeanor when cross-examined about his alleged Catholic beliefs (IJ at 4-5). Adverse
credibility findings based in part on demeanor findings warrant “particular deference.” Dong Gao
v. BIA, 482 F.3d 122, 126-27 (2d Cir.2007).
This deference, however, has limits. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
has expressly rejected the premise that “a certain level of doctrinal knowledge is necessary in order
to be eligible for asylum on grounds of religious persecution.” Rizal v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 84,90
(2d Cir. 2006). “Both history and common sense make amply clear that people can identify with
a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion's doctrinal
tenets, and that those same people can be persecuted for their religious affiliation.” Id.
The respondent is a forklift driver with a high school education (IJ at 5; Tr. at 43). He attends
church with his family and does not claim to be a religious teacher or church leader (IJ at 5; Tr. at
24-25, 37-40). There are some "instances in which the nature of an individual applicant's account
would render his lack of a certain degree of doctrinal knowledge suspect and could therefore
provide substantial evidence in support of an adverse credibility finding for instance, where an
applicant claims to have been a teacher of, or expert in, the religion in question. But this [is] not
the case here.” Id.
The Immigration Judge clearly erred in characterizing a question posed and the respondent's
answer. The respondent was asked “What’s [sic] the highest member of the Catholic church in
the religious hierarchy?” (Tr. at 46). The respondent apparently hesitated before correctly
answering the Pope (IJ at 5; Tr. at 46). The Immigration Judge inaccurately simplified this
question by describing it as “who was the head of the Catholic church” (IJ at 5). We cannot fault
the respondent for hesitating before correctly answer a convoluted question.

We acknowledge that the respondent did not know the difference between a bishop and a priest
and did not know who his bishop was in China (IJ at 5; Tr. at 46). We do not view this doctrinal
ignorance as undercutting the respondent's credibility in claiming to be a Catholic. We further
note that the respondent could not remember specific details about a Palm Sunday service
occurring the prior weekend, other than mentioning the sermon discussed the sufferings of Jesus
(IJ at 5; Tr. at 47-49). The respondent had previously immediately stated that Easter Sunday was
the coming Sunday (Tr. at 47). A person can undoubtedly be considered to practice a religion
without remembering the specific details of the prior week's service.
In sum, although some evidence supports the adverse credibility finding, we have a definite
and firm conviction that this finding is clearly erroneous. We also cannot affirm the Immigration
Judge's determination that the respondent presented insufficient corroborating evidence, as this
analysis is inextricably intertwined with the credibility determination. See section 208(b)(1)(B)(ii)
of the Act (“The testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant's burden
without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant's
testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the
applicant is a refugee.") (emphasis added).

decision and for the entry of a new decision.
