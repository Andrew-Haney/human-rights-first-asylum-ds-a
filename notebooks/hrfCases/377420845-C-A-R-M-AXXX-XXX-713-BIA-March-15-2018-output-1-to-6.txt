IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS: Pro se
APPLICATION: Continuanice
The respondents are siblings, ages 8 and 12, and both natives and citizens of Guatemala. They
appeal from the Immigration Judge's decision dated June 19, 2017, denying their request for a
continuance to apply for asylum and related relief. The record will be remanded.
At a group hearing held October 26, 2016, the respondents appeared pro se with their father
(Tr. at 7-8). The Immigration Judge provided the required advisals under 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10 and
gave the respondents a 4-month continuance to obtain counsel (IJ at 2; Tr. at 9-11). At the hearing
on March 6, 2017, the respondents' father appeared on behalf of the respondents, whose presence
was waived, and the Immigration Judge sustained the charges against the respondents
(Tr. at 14-15). The respondents' father stated that the respondents feared returning to Guatemala
because their mother threatened them, and also stated that their mother had abandoned them
(Tr. at 14-15). The Immigration Judge continued proceedings to give the respondent an
opportunity to consult with counsel regarding the possibility of obtaining special immigrant
juvenile status (Tr. at 18-19). The Immigration Judge cautioned that if the respondents' father
were to return at the next hearing without evidence that he was taking steps to pursue special
immigrant juvenile status, the respondents would not obtain a further continuance (Tr. at 19). The
Immigration Judge did not mention the possibility of applying for asylum.

At the next hearing on June 19, 2017, the respondents' father appeared again, pro se, and
indicated that he had not been able to retain an attorney to assist the respondents in applying for
special immigrant juvenile status (Tr. at 22). The Immigration Judge stated that the respondents
had waived their opportunity to apply for relief and stated that they would be ordered removed or
given voluntary departure (Tr. at 22-23). The respondents' father then asked whether he could
assist them in applying for asylum, and the Immigration Judge stated that they had lost their
opportunity to apply for asylum by not filing it by that date and ordered them removed (IJ at 2;
Tr. at 23-24).
We conclude that, under the particular circumstances in this case, a remand is warranted. If a
respondent expresses a fear of harm in a country to which he might be removed, the Immigration
Judge is required by regulation to advise him of the right to apply for asylum or withholding of
removal (including protection under the Convention against Torture) and to make the application
forms available. Matter of C-B-, 25 I&N Dec. 888, 890-91 (BIA 2012); 8 C.F.R.

713 et al.
$$ 1240.11(c)(1)(i), (ii). Here, the respondents' father, who appeared on behalf of the two minor,
pro se respondents, stated that the respondents did not want to return due to threats they had
received.' Although the Immigration Judge mentioned the possibility of other forms of relief, he
did not inquire about the respondents' fear or advise them of the right to apply for asylum and
related relief. Accordingly, the appeal is sustained, and the record is remanded to the Immigration
Judge for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Judge for further proceedings and the
entry of a new decision consistent with the foregoing opinion.

ORAL DECISION OF THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE
Now comes the Court on the above captioned cases before the Charlotte
Immigration Court. The respondents are juvenile males, both natives and citizens of
Guatemala. The older respondent is 12 years old and his brother is 8 years old.
Respondents at all times have been represented in the proceedings by their father,
A
R
The Department of Homeland Security advises, and Mr. R
concedes, that he is subject to a prior order of removal from the United States. Both
juvenile respondents were issued Notices to Appear on August 29, 2015. The
respondents, represented by their father, first appeared in the Immigration Court on
October the 26 of 2016. The Court granted a continuance until March 6 of 2017 for the
respondents to obtain assistance of counsel. At the hearing on March 6, 2017, the
Court granted a further continuance for the respondents to again seek assistance of
counsel and file their applications for relief.
At a master calendar hearing on June 19, 2017, the respondent's father,
again, appeared on their behalf. Mr. R
advised that he has been unable to afford
an attorney to assist his sons, and has been told that he needs to have more
information than he has available for them seek special immigrant juvenile status.
The Court finds that the respondents have been provided ample time to
seek assistance of counsel in these proceedings and to prepare their applications for
relief. The respondents have not filed their applications for relief by the deadline set by
the Court. The Court therefore finds that they have abandoned or given up their right to
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
file for asylum or other forms of relief.
The respondents, through their father, have advised they do not wish to
request voluntary departure. The Court therefore orders both respondents to be
removed from the United States to the country of Guatemala based upon the charges in
the Notices to Appear. The Court notes they have reserved their right to appeal and
must file their notice with the Board of Immigration Appeals no later than July 19, 2017.
