IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL AND MOTION
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: John F. Flanagan, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture; remand
In a decision dated September 17, 2018, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent's
application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against
Torture. Sections 208(b), 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. SS 1158(b),
1231(b)(3)(2012); 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.16(c), 1208.18 (2018). The respondent, a native and citizen
of Mexico, has appealed from this decision. While his appeal was pending, the respondent filed a
motion to remand. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
We review the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made by the
Immigration Judge under the “clearly erroneous” standard. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(2)(3)(i). We review
all other issues, including issues of law, discretion, or judgment, under the de novo standard.
8 C.F.R. S 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent is a member of the certified class in Franco-Gonzalez v. Napolitano,
No. CV-10-02211 DMG DTBX, 2011 WL 11705815, at *1-2 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011), who was
found incompetent to represent himself in removal proceedings on February 22, 2018 (IJ at 2-3).
For this reason, he was assigned a qualified representative and provided with other procedural
safeguards below pursuant to Franco-Gonzalez v. Holder, No. CV-10-02211 DMG DTBX, 2014
WL 5475097, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2014).
The sole issue we must decide at this time is whether the Immigration Judge properly
concluded that the respondent is statutorily ineligible for asylum under section 208(b) of the Act
(IJ at 3-4).' For the following reasons, we will not affirm the Immigration Judge's conclusion in
this regard.
The Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was statutorily ineligible for asylum
because his application for this form of relief was not filed within 1 year of his arrival in the United
States (IJ at 3-4). The respondent must establish either: (1) “[b]y clear and convincing evidence
1
The Department of Homeland Security has not challenged the Immigration Judge's
determination that the respondent has not been convicted of a particularly serious crime, and we
consider any arguments in this regard to be waived (IJ at 4-5). See, e.g., Matter of A.J. Valdez
& Z. Valdez, 27 I&N Dec. 496, 496 n. 1 (BIA 2018).

that [his) application has been filed within 1 year of the date of (his) arrival in the United States”;
or (2) “[t]o the satisfaction of ... the immigration judge() or the Board that he ... qualifies for an
exception to the 1-year deadline.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(A), (B). It is undisputed that the
respondent's application was not filed within this deadline (IJ at 3-4; Exh. 13 at 1; Respondent's
Br. at 3). To qualify for an exception to the deadline, the respondent must demonstrate “either the
existence of changed circumstances which materially affect (his) eligibility for asylum or
extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing (his) application” within the 1-year
period. Section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act.
We agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondent has not shown that his delusional
disorder is an “extraordinary circumstance” that prevented him from timely filing for asylum given
the uncertainty around when he entered the United States, 2 when his mental health issues
developed, and how severe his mental health issues were prior to May 30, 2017—when he was
placed in removal proceedings (IJ at 3; Exhs. 1, 10, 13, 14).
Nevertheless, we will not affirm the Immigration Judge's decision that the resp
dent's mental
health issues cannot qualify as "changed circumstances” within the meaning of section
208(a)(2)(D) of the Act (IJ at 4; Tr. at 201; Respondent's Br. at 8). 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(B)
(providing that changed circumstances under this provision include “[c]hanges in the applicant's
circumstances that materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum”). The Immigration
Judge reasoned that the respondent's mental health issues cannot qualify as changed circumstances
under section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act because his “mental state during his time while in the United
States may have fluctuated and at times may have been more severe than other(s)” (IJ at 4). We
do not find this reasoning persuasive.
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
The record does not establish whether the respondent's mental health issues have remained at
the same degree of severity throughout his time in the United States, or whether they have
fluctuated over time. But even if we assume, like the Immigration Judge, that the latter is true, the
record reflects that he was, in the Immigration Judge's words, “severely mentally ill” as of at least
April 4, 2018—about 2 months before he filed his application for asylum—when he underwent a
forensic competency evaluation (IJ at 4; Exh. 11). Following this evaluation, the respondent was
diagnosed with intellectual disabilities, “psychiatric instability(,) and (an) inability to sustain
attention due to psychosis” (IJ at 3-4; Exh. 10). Therefore, even if the respondent's mental health
issues were less severe in the past, this fact does not preclude him from demonstrating that the
current severity of his mental health issues qualifies as a “change (in his] circumstances” within
the meaning of section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(4)(i)(B).
It nevertheless remains to be seen whether these changes “materially affect the respondent's)
eligibility for asylum.” Id. But we cannot make this determination absent additional fact-finding.
2 As the Immigration Judge noted, the respondent's criminal record reflects that he has been
present in the United States since at least 2014, although the respondent asserts that he came to
this country in 2003 (IJ at 3; Exh. 13 at 1, 37; Respondent's Br. at 3).

The Immigration Judge assumed, without deciding, the viability of the respondent's proposed
particular social groups and that the harm he fears in Mexico will be inflicted on account of his
membership in these groups (IJ at 5; Respondent's Br. at 11). But he found that the respondent
had not met his burden of establishing his eligibility for withholding of removal (IJ at 5).
Significantly, the Immigration Judge did not analyze whether the respondent's mental health issues
materially affect his ability to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his
membership in these groups for purposes of asylum.“
In light of our limited fact-finding ability on appeal, see 8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(i), we will
remand the record to allow the Immigration Judge to address whether the respondent's proposed
social groups are cognizable under applicable legal standards and whether he has demonstrated a
well-founded fear of future persecution in Mexico on account of membership in these groups,
including whether feared harm stems from persecutory intent. See Matter of W-Y-C- & H-O-B-,
27 I&N Dec. 189, 191 (BIA 2018) (“A determination whether a social group is cognizable is a
fact-based inquiry made on a case-by-case basis ...." (citation omitted)); Matter of 2-2-0-, 26
I&N Dec. 586, 590 (BIA 2015) (holding that “an Immigration Judge's predictive findings of what
may or may not occur in the future are findings of fact”). Once this is done, the Immigration Judge
should determine whether the respondent has demonstrated “changed circumstances” within the
meaning of section 208(a)(2)(D) of the Act and filed his application for asylum “within a
reasonable period given those ‘changed circunstances. 8 C.F.R. $ 1208.4(a)(4)(ii); see also
Matter of T-M-H- & S-W-C-, 25 I&N Dec. 193, 193 (BIA 2010).S

On remand, the parties should be given the opportunity to submit additional evidence,
testimony, and arguments regarding these issues and any other issues the Immigration Judge deems
appropriate. Accordingly, the following orders will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion
and for the entry of a new decision.
FURTHER ORDER: The motion to remand is denied as moot.
Curral &
FOR THE BOARD
3 The respondent claims that he is a member of particular social groups comprised of the following:
(1) Mexicans with incurable delusion disorder who exhibit manic symptoms and bizarre, grandiose
delusions; (2) Mexicans viewed as “loco"; (3) Mexicans suffering from severe mental illness; and
(4) Mexican individuals subject to institutionalization for severe mental illness (IJ at 5).
4
In assessing the respondent's eligibility for withholding of removal, the Immigration Judge
found that it was not “more likely than not” that he would be persecuted on account of his
membership in his proposed groups, but this is a higher standard than the well-founded fear
required for asylum” (IJ at 5-6). Ming Dai v. Sessions, 884 F.3d 858, 874 (9th Cir. 2018).
5
Because we are remanding the record for further consideration of the respondent's eligibility for
asylum, we need not address additional issues at this time.
