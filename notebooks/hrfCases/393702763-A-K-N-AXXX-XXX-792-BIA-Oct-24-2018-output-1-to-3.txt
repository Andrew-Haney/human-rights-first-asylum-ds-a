IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Allyson Page, Esquire
ON BEHALF OF DHS: John Zachary
Assistant Chief Counsel
APPLICATION: Withholding of removal; remand
The respondent is a native and citizen of Russia. The Department of Homeland Security
(“DHS”) has appealed the Immigration Judge's August 1, 2017, decision granting the respondent's
application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3)(A) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A).' The respondent has filed a brief in opposition to the
appeal. The record will be remanded for further proceedings.

Prior to being issued a Notice to Appear on May 10, 2017, the respondent had previously been
in removal proceedings (IJ at 10; Tr. at 61-65). Those proceedings, however, were terminated
(Id.). On appeal, the DHS argues, among other things, that the Immigration Judge that presided
over the respondent's merits hearing and rendered a decision in this case on August 1, 2017, was
counsel for the DHS in the respondent's case during his initial removal proceedings several years
before (DHS’s Br. at 1, 5-7). The internal record system reflects that the Immigration Judge that
presided over these current proceedings was counsel for the DHS in the respondent's case during
his initial proceedings.
On appeal, the DHS argues that the Immigration Judge should have recused herself from the
respondent's case because she served “in a govemmental employment in such capacity as counsel,
adviser, or material witness concerning the proceedings or expressed an opinion concerning the
merits of the particular case in controversy””; the DHS cites to Memorandum for All Immigration
Judges, from Michael J. Creppy, Chief Immigration Judge, EOIR, Re: Operating Policies and
Procedures Memorandum 05-02: Procedures for Issuing Recusal Orders in Immigration
Proceedings at 5 (Mar. 21, 2005) (“OPPM 05-02') in support of its argument (DHS's Br. at 7).
We note that the respondent has not challenged the Immigration Judge's denial of his application
for asylum based on the one-year filing deadline, and his request for protection under the
Convention Against Torture (IJ at 13-14, 16).
2 Prior to the respondent's July 25, 2017, hearing and August 1, 2017, merits hearing, two different
Immigration Judges presided over the respondent's other master calendar hearings, held on
June 20, 2017, and July 11, 2017, respectively.

The DHS also notes in its brief that the Immigration Judge, in her role as counsel for the DHS
during the respondent's initial proceedings, reviewed the respondent's case at that time for
prosecutorial discretion (DHS’s Br. at 6, n.1). The DHS specifically requests that we remand for
the Immigration fudge to address its motion to recuse in the first instance.
We acknowledge the respondent's argument that the DHS failed to raise this issue during the
proceedings below (Respondent's Br. at 2, 8-12). However, under OPPM 05-02, an
Immigration Judge has an obligation to “sua sponte identify those circumstances where recusal
may be appropriate” (DHS’s Br. at 7). OPPM 05-02 at 2. Thus, based on the circumstances
presented in this case, we conclude that a remand is warranted for the Immigration Judge to
consider in the first instance whether her recusal in this case is appropriate. See id.; 8 C.F.R.
§ 1240.1(b) (“The Immigration Judge assigned to conduct the hearing shall at any time withdraw
if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified."); see also Matter of Exame, 18 I&N Dec. 303,
306 (BIA 1982) (stating, in the context of interpreting former section 236(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.
1226(a), that an Immigration Judge is precluded from hearing a case if the Immigration Judge has
participated in investigative or prosecuting functions involved in that particular case).
In light of our disposition in this matter, we decline to address the remaining issues raised by
the DHS in its brief. We express no opinion concerning the respondent's ultimate eligibility for
relief.? Accordingly, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings consistent
with the foregoing opinion and entry of a new decision.

FOR THE BOARD
3 Notwithstanding the above, should the Immigration Judge decide recusal is not warranted, she
should consider on remand the parties' appellate arguments regarding the merits of the case.
