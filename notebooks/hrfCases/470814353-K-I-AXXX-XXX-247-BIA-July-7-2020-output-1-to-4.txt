IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS
APPEAL
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT: Greg C. Proctor, Esquire
APPLICATION: Asylum; withholding of removal; Convention Against Torture
The respondent, a native and citizen of Burkina Faso, has timely filed an appeal from an
Immigration Judge's decision dated July 25, 2019, finding him removable as charged, and denying
his applications for asylum and withholding of removal under sections 208(a) and 241(b)(3) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. $$ 1158(a) and 1231(b)(3), respectively, and for
protection under the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R. $$ 1208.13, 1208.16-.18. The
record will be remanded to the Immigration Court for further proceedings.

We review for clear error the findings of fact, including the determination of credibility, made
by the Immigration Judge. 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i). We review de novo questions of law,
discretion, and judgment, and all other issues in appeals from an Immigration Judge's decision.
8 C.F.R. $ 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).
The respondent claims eligibility for relief from removal based on political opinion and on
membership in a proposed particular social group, described as “ex-military members who refuse
the orders of their commander” or, as clarified on appeal, “ex-military members who refused the
illegal and unhumanitarian orders of their commander" (IJ at 2; Tr. at 45) (see Respondent's
Br. at 11). See Matter of W-Y-C- & H-O-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 189, 191 (BIA 2018) (holding that an
applicant raising membership in a particular social group as the basis of the claim for relief has the
burden to clearly delineate the group to which she claims she belongs).'
The respondent testified that, when he was a soldier in the Burkina Faso armed forces, he and
a team of 5 soldiers led by a sergeant were sent to investigate a deadly attack upon members of
another unit (IJ at 3; Tr. at 22-23, 26-28). During the investigation, the team came upon and
detained 7 individuals who appeared to have been unarmed civilians (IJ at 3-4; Tr. at 28-30). The
team leader briefed the colonel (who was the commander of the base where they were stationed)
on the telephone, and the colonel ordered the execution of the civilians (IJ at 4; Tr. at 30-31). The

We note that although a particular social group must be clearly delineated before the
Immigration Judge and the Board does not accept delineation of a new particular social group on
appeal, the respondent herein appeared before the Immigration Judge pro se, and it is the
Immigration Judge who identified and delineated the particular social group for the respondent.
See Cantarero-Lagos v. Barr, 924 F.3d 145 (5th Cir. 2019). As such, we will not foreclose the
respondent from clarifying the definition of his proposed particular social group on appeal.

team members refused to carry out that order, they were relieved of their duties by another team
on the colonel's orders, and they were placed under arrest on the base (IJ at 4; Tr. at 31-33). The
respondent was charged with failing to obey an order of a superior officer (IJ at 4; Tr. at 39-40).
During the 2-week period of detention before the respondent escaped, he was beaten, had water
thrown on him, and was given only one meal a day (IJ at 4; Tr. at 33-35, 40, 44). The respondent
fears arrest, detention, and death at the hands of the military for failure to follow an order if he
were returned to Burkina Faso (IJ at 5; Tr. at 39).
The Immigration Judge denied relief based on an adverse credibility finding and, in the
alternative, on the merits (IJ at 5-8). On clear error review, and considering the "totality of the
circumstances,”
the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility finding.
See section 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. $ 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see also Wang v. Holder,
569 F.3d 531, 538 (5th Cir. 2009).

Specifically, the Immigration Judge based his adverse credibility determination on an
implausibility of the respondent's account that he was imprisoned, beaten, and subjected to other
deprivations by the military but, at the same time, his report that he was allowed to seek medical
treatment for a minor ailment while imprisoned (IJ at 6). The Immigration Judge also noted that
the respondent indicated on cross-examination that he previously applied for a United States visa
but did not report this during his interview with a border patrol agent (IJ at 6). However, the
Immigration Judge did not articulate specific, cogent reasons to support his adverse credibility
determination, and the totality of the circumstances does not support his determination (IJ at 6).
See Wang v. Holder, 569 F.3d at 538 (stating that an adverse credibility determination may be
supported by “any inconsistency or omission," provided that “the totality of the circumstances
establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible”) (internal quotation marks, emphasis, and
citation omitted). As such, we conclude that the adverse credibility finding was clearly erroneous,
and we will set it aside.

Moreover, on clear error review, we will reverse the Immigration Judge's finding that the
respondent did not demonstrate a nexus between his political opinion and the harm that he suffered
and fears at the hands of the Burkina Faso military. See Revencu v. Sessions, 895 F.3d 396, 402-
04 (5th Cir. 2018) (holding that the alien must demonstrate that political opinion was one central
reason for the claimed persecution); see also Eduard v. Ashcroft, 379 F.3d 182, 190-91
(5th Cir. 2004) (holding that an asylum seeker must demonstrate a nexus between the harm feared
and a protected ground). Although the Immigration Judge concluded that the respondent was
subjected to lawful prosecution for disobeying an order, the evidence reflects that the respondent
refused an order to kill unarmed civilians (IJ at 4, 7). As such, the evidence reflects that the
respondent was harmed because he refused to participate in inhumane conduct and, consequently,
that he was harmed on account of his political opinion. See Milat v. Holder, 755 F.3d 354, 362-
63 (5th Cir. 2014) (concluding that an asylum applicant's fear of punishment for evading military
service establishes a well-founded fear of persecution in only two circumstances, where the
applicant demonstrates that he would face disproportionate and severe punishment for refusing to
serve on account of a protected ground, or that military service will necessarily require the
applicant to participate in inhumane conduct). Likewise, although incarceration and subsequent
court martial hearing would amount to lawful prosecution, repeated beating and other significant
deprivations in pre-trial detention involve disproportionate and severe punishment. Id.

In view of the foregoing, the respondent's testimony and evidence of record persuade us that
the Immigration Judge's adverse credibility and nexus findings were clearly erroneous and that the
respondent's political opinion is at “at least one central reason” for the harm and threats he faced
(IJ at 7-8). See section 208(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Act.
Consequently, we will remand the record to the Immigration Court for further proceedings and
for reconsideration of the respondent's application for asylum, withholding of removal, and
protection under the Convention Against Torture. Specifically, the respondent, who represented
himself before the Immigration Judge, testified that he was subjected to beatings, deprivations,
and "torture” while in military detention for refusing to kill unarmed civilians. However, the
Immigration Judge did not question the respondent in detail with regard to the nature, severity, and
length of the beatings to which he was subjected, or the nature and severity of any injury or harm
that he may have sustained (Tr. at 33-34). Thus, on remand, the Immigration Judge should
determine whether the severity of harm that the respondent suffered in the past rises to the level of
persecution or torture. See Arif v. Mukasey, 509 F.3d 677, 680 (5th Cir. 2007) (noting that
persecution is an extreme concept that does not include all treatment our society regards as
offensive); Abdel-Masieh v. INS, 73 F.3d 579,584 (5th Cir. 1996) (concluding that beatings during
two separate arrests represented insufficient harm to rise to the level of persecution); cf. Matter of
N-M-A-, 22 I&N Dec. 312 (BIA 1998) (applicant detained for one month, periodically beaten,
deprived of food established that he suffered harm rising to the level of past persecution).
Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center, LLC | www.irac.net
If the Immigration Judge determines that the harm that the respondent suffered in the past rose
to the level or persecution or torture, the Immigration Judge should determine, by applying
appropriate analysis and legal standard, whether the presumption of future persecution and torture
have been rebutted in this case, and whether the respondent is otherwise eligible for asylum,
withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. See 8 C.F.R.
$$ 1208.13, 1208.16, 1208.17, 1208.18; see also Matter of M-Z-M-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 28
(BIA 2012); Matter of D-I-M-, 24 I&N Dec. 448, 450 (BIA 2008). The parties should be permitted
to submit additional relevant evidence. We make no determination regarding the ultimate outcome
of this case. In view of the foregoing, the following order will be entered.
ORDER: The record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion
and for the entry of a new decision.
