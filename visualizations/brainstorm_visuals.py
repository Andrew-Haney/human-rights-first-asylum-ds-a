# DATA ETHICS -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For the most part court records are public information.
# Try to keep more private information off the records.
# Possibly keep first names off, if people are that interested let them look online.
#
# Things to know
#   a) obtain informed consent from potential research participants
#              In most legal cases, court records are public. But be safe and double check.
#
#   b) minimise the risk of harm to participants
#              The Human Rights First Asylum is not trying to put people at risk or bring them harm.
#
#   c) protect their anonymity and confidentiality
#              Again. HRFA isn't there to put people at risk or bring them harm. However, it is possible
#              that by putting their information on site it may cause them complications. Don't use pictures,
#              FIRST and LAST names in conjunction, DOB information, as this may lead to legal complications for HRFA.
#
#   d) avoid using deceptive practices
#
#   e) give participants the right to withdraw from your research
#              Note: bring this up to Shareholders. It's possible to gain animosity by not allowing someone to withdraw
#              the information you are using about them. 
#
#
#       These 'ethics' vary from source to source. But stay relatively the same.

# VISUALIZATION IDEAS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   SOFTWARES--------------
#
# > Use Matplotlib extension Basemap (https://matplotlib.org/basemap/)
#   Using Basemap, we can plot coastal lines and countries directly.
#
#      Found example/walkthrough 
#      (https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-plot-data-on-a-world-map-in-python-25cf9733c3dd)
# 
# > Using Folium (https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)
#   Which creates an interactive map which you can add markers too
#
#       Found example/walkthrough
#       (https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/scientists-guide-to-plotting-data-in-python/plot-spatial-data/customize-raster-plots/interactive-maps/)
#
# > Using Plotly open source graphing (https://plotly.com/)
#   Can be installed via AWS(?)
#
#       Found example/walkthrough(https://plotly.com/python/maps/)
#

#    GRAPH IDEAS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# World map with Green (won cases), Grey (awaiting verdict/ not yet to trial), and Red (lost cases) dots representing cases across the nation
# 
# - information to show on a basic level
#       COUNTRY OF ORGIN
#       DATE
#       OUTCOME
#
# 
# Bar Chart showing number of male/female cases seeking asylums
#
# Heatmap showing influx of Asylum Seekers from regions of the world
# 
# Demographic Graph showing Ages/Races/Gender that have been granted/denied asylum.
