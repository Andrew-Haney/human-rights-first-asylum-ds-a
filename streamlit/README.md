# ABOUT:

The purpose of this streamlit app is to give an easily digestible way to showcase the current state of the data scraped from the BIA PDF documents to the stakeholder. Anything that it does can be done with pandas in a notebook, but the point is not abstract away the code as to not be overwhelming.

Roughly 75% of the ~3,500 documents are represented here.

# HOW TO RUN:

To run this app, make sure you `pipenv shell` in the root repository, `cd` to `./streamlit` and run the command `streamlit run asylum.py`. Open the supplied localhost link in your web browser.
